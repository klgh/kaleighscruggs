Hey I'm Kaleigh!

I am a recent graduate of Georgia Southern University! I graduated with a B.S. in Information Technology, specializing in Web & Multimedia, a 2nd discipline of Music Technology, and a minor in Music!

Now I'm in the awkward area between undergrad and grad school. I will be attending the University of Georgia in the fall getting my Masters in Internet Technology! While I wait, I am searching for my first real world job so I can start making some moolah and paying off my loans while I am living back at home in Atlanta. I want to be a front-end Web Developer and/or dealing with Social Media in some way. I am a tech/web geek!

I am also a growing Triathlon geek as well! I have already completed 2 Sprint Triathlons, and am registered for 2 more this year!

(I feel like I have used a lot of exclamation points...!!!!)

I originally started out as a runner in 10th grade when I joined my high school's Cross Country team. (I actually ran with the team 1 day in 9th grade, but I was convinced I was going to die so I didn't go back). I have been a runner ever since, and still am. Since then I  have done a lot of 5K races, and just one 10K (that will change July 4).

Last year, after I started dating my boyfriend Shaun, I realized I really like riding bikes other than to just take me to and from campus. So I got a better bike (my Schwinn Trailway Hybrid). Then I started riding a lot more and doing triathlons..so I got a (vintage) road bike ( Schwinn World). And I love bikes so much and having Shaun fix them that he rescued me a 1986 Sears Free Spirit that was a 10-speed, but is now a 1-speed (with a white chain!).

I make let Shaun fix my bikes because he knows what he is doing, unlike me, and has tools and likes to buy tools and save money doing his own bike repairs. We both have 3 bikes each (we're becoming [the Duggars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_Kids_and_Counting) slowly but surely) so it's pretty awesome that he is a great bike mechanic. But when he's not fixing bikes, he's wrestling for Georgia Southern's team,  keeping up his insanely high grades, working, or even hanging out with me! Shaun is also pretty awesome because he has become my Triathlon Coach and keeps me in line when I try to be lazy, pushes me when we work out together, and is my right hand on race day. Like legit. At my last triathlon, he got my transition area set up for me while I was running around picking up my race packet and freaking out. Best Boyfriend Ever.

Now that I've bored you, please let me know what I can do to make this blog better, or any other suggestion you may have in the comments!
