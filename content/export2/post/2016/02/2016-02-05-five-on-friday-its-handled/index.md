This Friday Five would have been about fitness related something, but just like this week, I'm gonna swoop in and be like "NO THANKS THIS IS NOT HOW IT'S GONNA GO". You know?

1// I finally had an injury screening and the PT told me I DEF have a bad case of plantar fasciitis, and because I've been letting that go on for oh, almost a year, I now have bursitis in my hip! So now I am going to call a podiatrist and get it handled

2// Even though Coldplay had a pre-sale going for a full week, I didn't get tickets. Anything that came up was either REALLY far away, or REALLY expensive and still not close enough for me to justify spending like $130 per ticket to still not be within arms reach. They are my most favorite band in the world, but really? I blame Ticketmaster. FU Ticketmaster!

Oh, but Shaun saw how sad I was that I didn't get any tickets and he said we can even go to Europe if I get better tickets for a concert there #BestHusbandEver

3// I'm REALLY excited for the weekend because work this week has been so hectic and stressful. Like I don't have any sort of plans, but I'm looking forward to 3:15pm. I want to go to kickboxing Saturday morning, but that's it. Oh and figure out how to watch the Super Bowl to see my boys (Coldplay) play the halftime show. They are the only people I know who are playing in the Super Bowl.

4// Since I'm on a Coldplay kick, please watch the video of Chris Martin doing carpool karaoke with James Cordon! Super funny!

5// 60 days until my 1st cruise!!! I'm super excited, and also pumped because the cruise is only costing us $9 (yay miles!), we get a free hotel (yay Hotels.com), and we're only paying for the flights. I'll take it!!

ok bye!
