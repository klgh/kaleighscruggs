Oh hey July! Sneaking up on us! I decided I'd share some of my favorite stuff I was obsessed with all month!

Chocolate Zico Water

Chocolate Zico Water is amazing. I want to drink it all day every day. It is especially good to have when you've finished a workout or just came in from the ridiculous heat and humidity.

Starbucks Pink Drink

If you haven't had this, you're missing out. It's the [Starbucks Acai Refresher with coconut milk](http://starbuckssecretmenu.net/starbucks-pink-drink-has-taken-over-instagram-the-internet/) instead of water. They throw in strawberries and more than enough ice.Â The refreshers have caffeine in them, so that's an extra bonus if you're half asleep!

The Office

In between all the crazy things that have happened this month, Shaun and I have been making our way through The Office. I wish my office was more like this office.

32oz Hydroflask

My [Hydroflask](http://www.hydroflask.com/32-oz-wide-bottle#92=54) has been a lifesaver all month. From my workouts, to just life in general, it's amazing because it keeps your water and ice COLD ALL DAY. Even if you leave it in your car. Love it.

Planning For Seattle

Our trip to Seattle is coming up and I have been trying to figure out what to do! I am definitely going on an orca whale watch. THAT IS FOR SURE #FreeWilly but that's all I really know. So suggestions are greatly appreciated!

**Have a great 4th of July weekend!**
