I hope everyone has had a great 3 day weekend! This past week was full of running around buying things to organize our new apartment, fitting in workouts, and work.

I took Monday off because I wasn't feeling too hot, but was able to hang some stuff in the apartment with Shaun. Our dining room, kitchen, master and guest bathrooms are all pretty much done! We do need to find a skinny curtain for our window in the bathroom, it's a tad creepy to have a window in there but also really nice to have natural light in the bathroom when I'm getting ready in the morning.

Our office/guest room is a HOT MESS right now. The closet is definitely storage, but since we need to buy some book shelves, and just go through everything to donate or sell, the whole room is soooo unorganized!

The master closet is slightly messy but only because we're using our dresser as a buffet in the dining room and now anything we used to keep in it is just in the most random places. There have been a lot of "lost" items lately! The living room is about done too, we just need to get something to put by the door for keys, shoes, random stuff.

I was able to work out every day this week, but the 2 workouts I did at our apartment gym felt so rushed since I had other stuff on my mind. This week I'm planning on going to the gym every day since we're gonna miss it next week while on vacation!

Shaun had a test on his stomach Monday to see how fast or slow it 'empties'. He was done within an hour, which is not normal. They said it could be good or bad. So more waiting to see what that means. But on the bright side, he has been feeling much better this week and is able to eat different things with no pain! Woo!

In blog news, I have been (slowly) learning how to make custom templates, and will hopefully be able to debut them soon! Also, starting tomorrow, I will be doing 'Tech Tuesdays'! I am very excited about this! I'll be writing about all sorts of tech related subjects! Tomorrow is all about domain names!
