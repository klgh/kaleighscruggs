I have gotten a few questions about buying domain names and how it works, so here's my quick guide on how to be "official"!

Decide where you'll buy your domain name from. I like to use [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) because, well, it's cheap. It only costs $10.69 for a whole year with a .com  name. Other ones might be cheaper if they're not a .com (or more expensive) depending on what the name is and availability. Sometimes your name is taken, so you have to get creative.

NameCheap asks if you want to get [WhoisGuard](http://www.whoisguard.com/) for about $2.88 (or for free). DO IT. Basically what it does is protect your personal information. When you register for a domain name, you give your name, phone number, address, email, all sorts of personal info you might not want the whole world to see. WhoisGuard protects you and uses their information instead. So if someone does [look your site up](https://www.whois.net/), it will just forward you whatever emails they try to send you.

With any site, before you check out, do a quick Google search to see if you can use a coupon code to get a discount! This is another reason why I like NameCheap, they have a page full of their latest promos!

You'll also be asked if you want to add hosting to your website. If you plan on hosting your own site, you can do that here. If you use Blogger, Tumblr, or Squarespace, you don't need to get it. But if you want to use the full WordPress.org then you'll want to buy hosting (and make sure they do WordPress!).

WOO! Now you own your domain name!

\*Be aware that sometimes it doesn't start working instantly. It might take a few minutes to an hour. If you don't see it after an hour DEFINITELY contact support!

Now, how do you actually use it?

[This is a good guide for Blogger](https://support.google.com/blogger/troubleshooter/1233381?hl=en). If you bought hosting, it should be fairly easy to get it going.  This is a guide for [installing WordPress on Name Cheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/1255/29/how-to-install-wordpress-using-softaculous). It's pretty straightforward. Just make sure you read everything carefully and don't get overwhelmed! When installing WordPress, when it asks for directory...leave it blank! Unless you want it to be like codebikerun.com/blog, leaving it blank will leave it at codebikerun.com.

And that's it! Please let me know in the comments or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaleighscruggs) if this is helpful, or if you'd like more information!
