Happy Monday!

I know this is SUPER last minute, but I decided to create 12 Days of Blogmas!! (woo!) What is it? Just 12 straight days of blog posts (and/or Instagram pics)! I figured it would be fun to have a blog hop and everyone can share what they've posted. If you go the Instagram route, just be sure to mention the day in that day's post!

I also have a hashtag! #DailyBlogmas16

Here are the days and what to post on each day. You can come back here to join the hop and see what's been posted! I only ask that you comment on my post that you're participating, and a few others as well! Share the love!!

Tomorrow just come back here and you'll see my 1st post with the bloghop to add your post!

You can also use this button to add to your posts!
