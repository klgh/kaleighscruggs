Happy National Cocoa Day!! If you know me, then you know I love my hot chocolate in the winter!! And if I'm not at work, then you know I've added some Bailey's to it!

On Christmas Eve my parents usually have friends and family over and I'm in charge of bartending. Every year I try to find a new signature drink. Usually it's something with vodka. I need to start planning this year's drink!

What's your favorite Holiday Drink?
