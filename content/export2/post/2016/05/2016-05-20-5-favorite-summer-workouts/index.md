Happy Friday! Summer is right around the corner, and I thought it'd be fun to list 5 great workouts you can do in the upcoming hot months. I live in Atlanta, aka Hotlanta, it can get pretty humid and hot here. It's lovely. So here's my 5:

// Biking // I love to bike in the summer because you can usually get a nice breeze, especially here in Georgia, and it cools you off. I also enjoy it because since it's lighter later, it's perfect for an after work workout. Plus there are some trails I like that are shaded so that helps a ton.

// Kayaking // If you know me, you know I love kayaking! Last year my husband and I finally bought our own kayaks and living right on the Chattahoochee has been perfect. It's a great arm and core workout, plus you can get some sun, and cool off a bit in the river. It can also be dangerous, of course, so we always make sure we tell people we're going out, bring and wear a ton of sunscreen, I have my epi-pens, and always have our life jackets. We like to bring our dog, Mac with us at the beginning and end of the season (middle of the summer is too hot for a black dog in the hot sun!).

// Running // I might be in a love/hate relationship with running right now, but that doesn't stop it from being a good summer workout. Talk about sweating! It is very important to be careful when running in the humidity, so when I do, it's either early morning, or at night. I always feel great after a summer run. Just be sure to stay hydrated before and after!

// Hiking // Same with running, it's best to do it in the morning or late afternoons, but hiking is great in the summer. It's fun to go to new places and see some sights! Depending on where you're going, bug spray is a must!

// Swimming // Can't forget the #1 summer activity! Going to the lake, beach, or pool is always fun either as a workout, or just hanging out!

What do you like to do as a summer workout?
