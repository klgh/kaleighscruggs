This is my 1st post on my re-vamped blog! Welcome new readers and old friends! Some people already know me because I have this habit of starting blogs, changing names, then deleting their existence because I don't know what I want to do with it.

Well, I am back, and ready to do my blog MY WAY! I will be honest, I got inspired after watching [Helene's](http://www.heleneinbetween.com/) latest webinar the other day. She's a blogging genius, and has just launched, [Blog Boss Babe](http://www.blogbossbabe.com/#_l_2i). It's a private community and forum where bloggers can go to learn, connect, and better themselves. There's so much more to that, but that's my quick, in-a-nutshell explanation.

<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4-qRsfGfi8c/VzZCLVo6q5I/AAAAAAAAL5k/oQSZyzG_qkAJUmDlzHFlRv5m5L5FSubXACLcB/s1600/bbb%2Bmug%2Bup%2Bclose.jpg"><img title="blogbossbabe.com" src="images/bbb%2Bmug%2Bup%2Bclose.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="295" border="0"></a></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;">blogbossbabe.com</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you want to know more about me, check out my About page, and of course we'll get to know each other as time goes on :) Also, be sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaleighcodes) and myÂ [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codebikerun/). I also LOVE Pinterest, so stalk all the food I want to eat and workouts to burn it off there as well.

And, last but not least, subscribe! I'm working on refreshing my [Bloglovin](https://www.bloglovin.com/blogs/codebikerun-12713491) feed, but that should be up soon!

Introduce yourself, ask questions, and let me know what you think!
