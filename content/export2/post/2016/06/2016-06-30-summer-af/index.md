So I did something kinda crazy but not last night...I created this [t-shirt on Teespring](https://teespring.com/summer-af#pid=95&cid=2261&sid=front):

The other day I was thinking of fun tanks to wear to the gym or around on weekends. I have been saying it's "summer AF" all summer, and decided I wanted it on a shirt. I don't know how to screen print, or own any sort of printer, and then I discovered Teespring (this isn't sponsored BTW).

SOOO, if you're interested, get a shirt! I have some more ideas, so we'll see what happens...

There are 3 options, 2 different tanks and a t-shirt. Let me know what you think, and if you really want one, buy one! My goal is to sell 20, so I _believe_Â you don't get charged unless at least 20 are ordered, and once the campaign is over on July 21.
