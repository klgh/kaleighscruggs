Hello to my thousands of readers.

Last Thursday night, Chris Martin was on Conan, and he talked about how at the Pittsburgh show, this girl yelled out at him as he was about to play a song, so he stopped to respond back to her. He also specificallyÂ mentioned it's on YouTube. Well, I was at that show, the girl yelled out (eff me), so I started filming. I posted it on YouTube the day or so after, and only had like 10 views. Friday, I woke up to over a THOUSAND views. And now, it's about to hit 10k. Pretty insane, amiright? Here's the video if you're interested or want to give it more views.

In other news, I have a full blown cold (although at times I feel normal-ish and do dishes or something). I worked this morning and then was like LOL JK NVM.

I have been super excited from Sunday's stand up performance, so I have scheduled 2 open mics. One November 15th and the 2nd is the 21st at LAUGHING SKULL. Super excited, and also super nervous! If you're in Atlanta and would like to come, please let me know for realz.

I also got my video back from Sunday. Here are my take aways:

1\. The quality is great! 2. it's super weird to watch myself perform something I've written 3. I'm really glad I wore my donut sweater. 4. You can tell I was nervous because I swayed the whole time.

It's on YouTube, but it's unlisted (bwahaha). If you'd like to see it though, just comment or email me and I'll send you the link.

Alright, time for some more tea!
