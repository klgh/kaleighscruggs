While I sit around and try to decide what I'm going to do with my life blog. I figured I'd post here since I recently remembered I had Wordpress installed on this domain. This is a top secret place that I test out Wordpress themes before I put them on other barely visited pages. No big.

OMG I am so excited for FALL. I'm so glad it's here!! Like, where have you been all my life? Just because I'm not 100% white ([believe it](http://dna.ancestry.com/public/ethnicity/022e9946-6992-48bc-ad9c-9b9915afd3a6/2b50218b-1a8f-4933-ad8b-edcc56c44437)), doesn't mean I can't partake in all of the basic white girl fall activities! I have already bought all the pumpkin drinks at Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. I have worshipped at the Pumpkin displays in Trader Joe's. And I have candles that smell like pumpkin + other basic things from Bath & Body Works. My nails are orange. I AM READY FALL!

There are so many other fall related things I can't wait to participate in. Def jackets, sweaters, and being cozy. Being cozy on the couch, and snuggling my dog who gets snuggly this time of year. Also, this weekend Shaun and I are going camping!!! This is my first LEGIT camping trip. I went camping in Girl Scouts, but that just means sleeping in cabins on bunk beds. This will be legit. I can't wait to share about it afterwards. Look out for some sweet posts on Instagram!

ok bye!
