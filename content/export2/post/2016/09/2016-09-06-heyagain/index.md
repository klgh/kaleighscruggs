I can't believe it's already September!! Of course I am crazy excited about fall (pumpkin everything plz), but this summer has flown by!  I wanted to post an update since I haven't really been posting at all lately!

I've been doing jiu-jitsu for a little over a month now and I love it!! It's a ton of fun and there is so much for me to learn, it's not even funny! I've been going about 4 times a week, 2 gi classes and 2 no-gi. Jiu-jitsu = laundry every day. If I were to get another gi, that would help, but I'll wait on that. I really recommend anyone trying jiu jitsu, it's not only a great workout, but so interesting after watching it for a few years, to see how moves go and everything. I'm planning on doing a 1st time jiu jitsu post since it's been hard for me to figure out what I need to wear as a female and all that fun stuff.

Stand up has been going really great as well. I've only had a couple of classes but it is absolutely awesome and just what I've needed. Getting used to writing and finding time is a little tough, but once I get going it's hard to stop. I don't know when my graduation show is, but I'm already nervous super pumped!

Work has been absolutely crazy. I have been getting canker sores nonstop for months now. It's getting rare that I don't have one or don't feel one coming/going. I have been getting them all my life but they usually appear around the most stressful times like finals, big events, or even if I just bite my cheek too hard or something. But now it's getting annoying. I don't know what to do! There's no way to prevent them (from what I've read). Try to be less stressed? I'm trying. But it doesn't help that I also recently found out that stress is the number 1 reason why people in my company go to the doctor! I'm usually the type of person who doesn't take things home, and doesn't view things as a big deal (which sounds weird since I have anxiety) but it's getting hard to leave it all at work. Argh!

[The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Lower-Back-Tattoo/dp/1501139886). I pre-ordered this on Audible before I quit my trial, and let me tell you....it's AMAZING. I love Amy Schumer, but her book was the greatest (being read aloud by her was also great too). It took me almost a week to finish while driving around and doing some workouts. I laughed, wanted to cry (Kaleigh doesn't cry), and was inspired even more in my stand-up journey. I am seeing her live in October, and now I can't even wait!

[Coldplay](http://coldplay.com/). I'm having serious withdrawals. They just finished this 1st leg of the US tour and I'm sad. But since I know they'll be back in the Southeast next summer, I'm already excited and dreaming of hopefully finally meeting them. I am already planning.
