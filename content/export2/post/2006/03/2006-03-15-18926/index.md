I just thought that I'd post something on here since I haven't in a while....myspace is better... [http://www.myspace.com/mtradefair](http://www.myspace.com/mtradefair) ...anyways, everything is going great, or "fabulous" in Sex & The City terms...one of my new obsessions since my last post I guess....what else? If you want to talk to me, send me a message on myspace, and if you don't have one, get one..haha..
