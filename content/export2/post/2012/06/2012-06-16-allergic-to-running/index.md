I am allergic to running. It is as stupid as it sounds. Not in the running makes me sweat and tired way, sadly. But in the running makes my eyes really itchy and swollen, I cough a lot, sneeze, and it gets a bit harder to breathe. This all happens so fast and it’s pretty scary.

It is a real, but rare, condition called “Exercise Induced Anaphlaxis” . Luckily this doesn’t happen every time I work out, just randomly. But the random part sucks. I have to always be prepared and know a quick way to get home and start taking Benedryl. I been lucky enough to not have to use my Epi-Pen, and hope I never have to. But it’s there just in case.



The first time this ever happened was really confusing because I had no idea why I was having an allergic reaction. I was running inside at GSU’s gym and only did a few laps before my eyes felt itchy. I thought something got in them so I went to the bathroom. My eyes were red but I shrugged it off and kept running. 2 laps later I was feeling even more itchy and irritated, so I went back into the bathroom and noticed my eyes were swelling up and really red. I started coughing too. I knew this was a bad sign. I luckily rode to the gym with my boyfriend so I grabbed my stuff and went downstairs to find him. I ran up to him and said “something’s wrong”. He looked at me and then did a double take and asked what was going on. I had no idea and of course I didn’t have any allergy medicine with me because I was at the gym. Why would I bring that there? We left immediately and I got to my apartment, took Benedryl and jumped in the shower.

I thought I might be allergic to my sweat, maybe it had gotten in my eyes. Or maybe a cleaning product that was used and I touched my hand to my face. None of it made sense. 2 months later, this happened again. I was inside, and had to leave to take Benedryl. A few months later this happened again, at an apartment gym. Then 3 months after that, but I was outside. This time it was easier to tell it was coming on because I was sneezing a lot and felt like my allergies were acting up. But by the time I got home, my eyes we swelling up. This time though it took 24 hours for the swelling to go down. Kind of embarrassing.

this is just funny..

Since then this has happened a few more times. Less than a month ago this happened while I was at home, running near my house with my dog. This was the first time I was alone when it happened, other times I have been with my boyfriend who knows exactly what to do and doesn’t even laugh at my swollen face but thinks I look cute. Crazy.

I’m the opposite of Classy when I’m having a reaction.

I was supposed to get an allergy shot that day for my fire-ant allergy but I knew it was a bad idea to make my body go through any more that day. The next day I was still pretty swollen so I called the nurse at the allergist to ask what I should do. She told me about some antihistamine eye drops I can get. I love those things now.

I think the reaction starts after I have eaten a big meal and then try to run, even a few hours after. So lately I have been making sure if I do eat before I run it’s only a very small snack. A few of the reactions I have had, I had meals 2 or less hours before running.
