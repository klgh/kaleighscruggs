I must let you all know that last week I bought something magical….

A foam roller!! This 3 in 1 one from Wal-Mart: [Awesomeness](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Gold-s-Gym-3-in-1-Massage-Roll/17804156)

It comes with a high density foam, low density foam, and a massage stick. And a dvd that shows you how to use it. It hurts so good! My whole left leg in the IT band area/knee has been super tight lately so this has started helping with that. Yesterday I foam rolled THREE separate times…that’s how awesome it is!

Right now I have been calling 20 volunteers that I will be working with next week at the Atlanta Coldplay show with Oxfam! This will be my 9th Coldplay show and 4th time working with Oxfam at a show. I am also addicted to Coldplay.. It is such a great experience and this is my second time being a city team leader. I am in charge of making sure everyone knows where to go, what they’re doing and all that fun stuff. So next week at this time I’ll be at the Phillips arena, and I will definitely be posting next Tuesday all about the Oxfam volunteering and the show! I can’t wait!
