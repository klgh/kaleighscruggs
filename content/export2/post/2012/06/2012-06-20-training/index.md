I am currently training for 2 upcoming triathlons I have planned, plus a 10k. Really the only thing I think about when I workout is the July 15th triathlon at Crow’s Lake. I know that I will be able to run the 10k. It’s the Peachtree Road Race on July 4th, it’s going to be fun and hot so I’m not worried. And it involves getting free things. win-win. The second tri isn’t until September 15, so I’m definitely not worrying about it anytime soon.

I have a training plan I’m following that I got from USA Triathlon and I follow it on [TrainingPeaks](http://home.trainingpeaks.com/). I put it into my google calendar because I’m cool like that so every day I know what I have to be doing, and refer to the webpage or app when I need more details about the workout.

What is not in my training plan is that my left knee has been killing me. After the tri in April I went to GSU’s trainers and they said my patellar is inflamed. So they said to ice it and stay off of it. That was hard because I love working out and at school riding my bike is more common than driving my car places. But eventually it stopped hurting. So I thought I was good. Then over the past week it has been slowly hurting more and more. Yesterday it hurt while I was at work, then I went and did a 20 minute spin followed by a swim. That killed me.

My knee was noticeably swollen, and so I took pain killers, iced it and used some cream my mom gave me. Today it’s been fine. I don’t know if I should work out and risk it hurting again or, stay off of it and have a 2nd rest day this week.

I just love to work out and feel gross if I don’t! But I also don’t want to hurt myself. Decisions..
