For the next week, (hopefully less), me and my family will all be waiting on the newest Leach to make an appearance. My brother and his girlfriend are expecting their first child any day now. The baby is officially due on Saturday the 14th, but of course, could come at any time. This is both exiting and stressful. I am just praying that he comes before I have to leave to go back to Southern. Classes start on the 17th, but I usually like to get back a few days early to settle in, unpack, grocery shop, and have a last moment of relaxing before the semester starts. So ideally, if the baby comes before the due date all this can be done. But you can't really plan in these situations, so who knows when I'll be leaving. I know by Saturday I'll be packed and ready to go. But if the baby isn't here, I'll try to stay in town as long as I can.

Anyways. Yesterday I took Lucy on a run for a 2.65 mile run, about 28 minutes. It was a hard run for whatever reason. My legs felt kind of tired, kind of sore. I don't really know why. This week I worked out a few times in the basement with my moms step and 5 pound dumb bells. ( I tried to do the old step vhs video, buns of steel, but I'm not coordinated at all). When I got home from the run, I did some weights, and ab workouts.

After showering, I began my yearly cleaning. Every year I like to clean out my room, and get rid of stuff I don't need or use. This being said, I still have a lot of crap I can't get rid of. I have so much jewelry box stuff, but I don't need or use it. I don't wear a lot of jewelry so I only need one or 2 boxes. I have a stack of magazines to go through and see if I want to cut anything out for a possible vision board. Next up is clothes. And something to put cards in. then I should be done.

Time to work on my room!
