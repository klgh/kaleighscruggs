That's all for now!!

In other news..today I have been procrastinating doing both supplemental parts of my applications for the 2 grad schools I've been applying to. I don't know why, it's the easiest thing (or so it seems). I have to write a statement of purpose..semi easy, and describe myself and my education and what I want to do with the degree. Yet I can't do it. argh! gotta get it done!

I also cleaned out ALMOST ALL of my stuff from my brother's closet. I moved out of my old bedroom at the end of summer 2010, into my brother Nick's old room, that my parents then made the lounge. So when I moved out my old room, I went into that room, and Max moved into my old room and we moved the lounge into Max's old room. Kind of confusing?

Well my old room was HUGE, and now that I think back on it, it made me keep ALOT of random crap, and was just difficult. I think I do better in smaller rooms (thanks college), so the move has been good. I still left a lot of stuff in the closet because I didn't have room in my new closet or time to deal with it since I left for school 2 days later. I have finally cleared almost all of it out for him. The only remaining thing is my giant American Girl Doll collection. And their accessories. I don't know what to do with them!

Now I have a headache from all the dust, it was much worse earlier though, and smashed my hand between the doorway and the container I was carrying. Ow.

 

Yesterday, with all the old magazines I'm going to throw away, I made a "Vision Board". Something my parents have a lot of because of yoga teacher training workshops they go to and stuff. My mom was so excited I made one.

I put stuff in there that's not really a "vision" but things I like..like Coldplay and Vibrams.

My family has been VERY careful about what we put on it since back in the spring when my Dad made his, he put a picture of a guy throwing a baby in the air, because he said he wanted to spend more time with his kids....then my brother Nick and his gf Kristen became pregnant. Coincidence? Crazy.

 

Another day down, another day without the new baby Leach. When will he get here??
