Happy New Year! There's a lot already for me to look forward to this year..first up is patiently waiting for my nephew to be born. I just made a baby pool online so people can guess for $3 and see who who gets the date, time, weight and length closest. That should be fun. I'm also looking forward to training this semester for triathlons and maayyybee a half marathon. I'm graduating in May, and seeing if I decide to go to Grad school right away or if I find a job. Right now I'm supposed to be starting applications...but I'm writing this post instead. :)

This weekend was pretty fun, I spent a lot of time with Shaun's family, and also mine. We had his family Christmas party on Saturday where after many trades ended up with a Swiss army knife for me and a foot bath and pedicure set for both of us. Feets need love too.



More post later..time to help my mom find her boots! My brother and I got her a gift card to Off Broadway so she can finally get herself some boots!
