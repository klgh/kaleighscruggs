I guess so. It doesn't feel like Thursday yet! AH! That means next week at this time...it'll be the weekend (kinda sorta) for me. Crazy. I'm excited about going back to Statesboro to get into a better schedule and work out better, but at the same time it's my last semester as an undergrad, and that is pretty scary!!

We are still waiting on the baby.....annd still waiting right now too...



This morning I turned on my Kindle, and saw this lovely black line down the middle:

So I checked to see what the Amazon warranty looked like, and went online to their customer support, and after putting in I needed Kindle help, it called my phone and I was connected with a rep! I explained that nothing crazy happened to my Kindle, and he said it's a manufacturing defect, and they are sending me a new one by Saturday, and I have already sent back my Kindle. I just had to deactivate my account so all my stuff was gone, and printed my free shipping label..and it should be on its way! SO EASY. That's why I love Amazon. Now to wait for my new toy :)

So now I'm waiting for a baby and a new toy to arrive on Saturday. AH!
