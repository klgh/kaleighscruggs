Hello! Sooo training Tuesday..What I have done in the past week, training wise!

Weds Jan 4- Did a step workout video in the basement. My coordination is not so good..but I added 5lb weights, then did ab workouts after as well as pushups.

Thurs Jan 5 - nada

Fri Jan 6- Did my own step workout with weights, then did a series of core workouts

Sat Jan 7- ran and did abs and core

Sun Jan 8- more weights, abs, and core

Mon Jan 9 - nada

Tues Jan 10- nada ( had an allergy shot)



Lots of core...lol

Still waiting on the baby. I went to Starbucks with my bro/dad-to-be Nick, and he said they're thinking the baby will come after it's due date...wahh!! He told me some statistic about first borns coming a week and a day after the due date...aka, Sunday January 22..AH! My fingers and toes are crossed so much for this baby to come before I have to leave. But knowing my luck and my history of being left out of things, I'll miss it :(

reminds me of:

I'm reading this book right now on my Kindle..really funny!
