Grad school applications. Yep. Doing that.

All this week I've been working on 2 applications to grad school. I actually started a 3rd, to my same school, GSU, but I've decided to wait on that one. Or at least that is what I've decided for this week.

I have had to send transcripts, and emailed teachers for recommendations. For one school, I _thought_ I only needed 2, and so I was going to wake up and submit the application after getting the OK from 2 professors, but the application won't let me go on without submitting a 3rd! What?! I emailed the head guy of the program asking him what's up..so hopefully he replies soon. Recommendations for these 2 schools are easy, and smart...I enter who I'm getting a recommendation from and their email, then once I submit my application, they get an email with a link to the place where they submit it. Kind of genius.

 

I am still deciding on triathlons and things to do..because yesterday I found out the triathlon that they usually have at my school in the spring isn't happening.. or "we have no plans" for it. So that stinks. The ONE tri that would have been the easiest to get to and to practice for. Oh well.

I am excited because on the website for my school's gym, they have swim workouts posted, for beginners, intermediate, and expert! That's pretty cool... definitely gonna start with the beginner..and as soon as I get back!

 

Now I must go, Lucy has a hot date at a dog park in Norcross with Emily and her dog Annabelle!
