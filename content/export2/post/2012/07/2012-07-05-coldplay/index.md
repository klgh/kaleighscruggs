There has been a lot going on this past week. First up was Coldplay!

On Monday I was a volunteer with Oxfam America at the Atlanta Coldplay concert. I have volunteered with them before, and this time I was acting as the team leader for Atlanta. I had such a great time. It s always an exciting experience because everyone is so excited and feels strongly about the issues we’re informing fans about.

We were talking about their Grow campaign and how 1 in 7 people around the world go hungry every day, even when we have enough food for everyone to eat. Crazy right? Learn more [here](http://www.oxfamamerica.org/campaigns/food-justice "Oxfam Grow") .

I met Rachel who is the Oxfam representative who gets to travel with Coldplay to all their shows and represent Oxfam. She was the nicest! She’s from London, so that was super cool (I LOVE London), and was short too, so me, my mom, and my friend Annette, all fit in! We got everything set up, ( I went backstage!) then went to meet the rest of the volunteers.Once we met them, we went over what Oxfam is, what we were campaigning about, and what we would be doing.

We gave out pins just like those, took pictures of fans who wanted to pose with volunteers dressed as food

me & Annette

That is one of the pictures we took with the tablets. Annette is dressed as a tomato. After we were done campaigning , we all helped clean up the booth and it was time to get our tickets. There was a mix up and Rachel had to go back to the production office..which was downstairs..backstage. So me, my mom and Annette got to go backstage to help her drop off her stuff and get our tickets! After what felt like forever because we were so excited and the show was about to start, we got our tickets! Rachel came out and said “I hope you don’t mind these FLOOR SEATS!”. Talk about excitement!!! We said our goodbyes and thank you’s and went to find our seats.

We were pretty close 

The Xylobands were SO cool!

I just love Coldplay and seeing them live. They are just great, and put on the best show.

I actually wrote a blog post for the Oxfam on Tour with Coldplay blog, so hopefully that will be up soon on their site!
