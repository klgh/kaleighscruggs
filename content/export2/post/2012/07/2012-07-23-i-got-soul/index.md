The day after my last post, I went with my parents to go look at the Kia Souls. I fell in love with them back in March when we test drove one because my mom is also in need of a new car. Of course I still loved them. I wanted an Alien green Soul, in a manual transmission. I test drove a 2013 automatic base, which was pretty loaded. I was impressed, (and so were my parents!). I loved the way it drove and the size/height of the car was perfect for me.

Later that day I went to a different Kia dealer to test a manual, but they were all out, so a few days later I finally found one and test drove it. Although I do love manual, the majority of my driving for the next 2 years will be in Atlanta during traffic times. Sitting at a long red light reminded me how lovely it is to push the clutch in for a million years.

I tested the Ford Fiesta, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Accent, and Nissan Versa. I loved the size of the Versa, but it didn’t have all the features I wanted. I also loved the Accent, but it was so small. One day my dad and I went to sit in an Accent and then went across the street to sit in a Soul. I loved the Soul. It was the perfect size for me, and I just loved it. So I obsessively searched the internet for the exact Soul I wanted.

I didn’t know about this until a few weeks ago, but Costco has an auto program that gives it’s members special pricing. My parents both have memberships so I logged on to see what the prices were like. They offer $1000 less than MSRP. And they also honor other rebates you may qualify for. I had my dad call one of the reps at the dealer they gave us and he gave us a LOT of good information about what it would be like if I bought or leased. So I filled out the pre-qualify info online and sent it in. I ended up having to get my mom be my co-signer since I don’t have a lot of credit history. Once she filled out her form, they told us we were good and I liked the numbers they gave us so I went online and found they had the exact car I wanted. Perfect? So we jumped in the car and went to the dealer!!

I was a little nervous but also excited. I was about to get a new car but I am the one paying for it!I know that I can manage it though and that I’ll be responsible with my money. I decided to lease, because not paying off a car until I’m almost 30 sounds pretty scary to me. Yes I have to watch my mileage, and keep my car in good shape (not hard for me), but in 3 years I can decide if I want to keep paying for it or get a new car. That sounds better to me right now.

Once we got to the dealership, I got to see my car, and sign my name on a million papers. Our salesman and the sales manager were both really nice..especially since we didn’t leave until an hour and a half after they closed! When I finally got to get into my car it was just crazy! I was really excited and I got a quick rundown of what all the knobs and buttons do. Then I was on my way!

Me and my 2013 Alien Green Kia Soul (automatic):

I love my car! I am still getting used to the size and parking and all that. Also my phone doesn’t like my car’s bluetooth but that’s the only thing I don’t like!I love my free for 90 days satellite radio and that I can at least play my iTouch through bluetooth. I bought a new GSU Alumni sticker for my car, but am scared about putting it on. I put on my “Tri” magnet and USA Triathlon window cling (you can barely see it though since the windows are tinted).
