Wednesday was my 2nd time running the AJC Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta. It was HOT!

My time was not even a minute different from last years, which I was a little bit bummed about because it was my 2nd 10K and I wanted to have a PR. But it was super hot and humid, and when I started the race the warning level was Yellow, and during the middle and the end, it turned to Red. I made myself run the first 3 miles because I know I could do that with no problem. but after I got water at the 3rd, I had to walk. My knee was hurting and I was so overheated. I cooled down and ran/walked for a while until I realized I missed the 4mile mark. So I didnâ€™t know my split for that mile. Once I got to mile 5, I made sure I would run the last mile, and walk only for a few seconds if I needed to. I ran the whole way to the end. It was hard and hot, but I did it. And got my shirt!

My aunt and uncle ran it with me so that was fun, but we all split up to run our own paces but finished all in the same 10 minutes. After I finished I felt the rush of heat, I grabbed a water bottle and had water until I felt bad, then got an ice cold Delta towel and put it on my head-Heaven. I felt instantly better. I got some free bananas and bagels from Publix and went to find my family by the letter balloons.

That is my magical friend post race

3 in 1 you are awesome.
