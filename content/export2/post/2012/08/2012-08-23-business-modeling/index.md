This business model is modeled after Georgia Southern's Concessions, where I worked for 4 years. Concessions was a part of Eagle Dining Services and were at every Athletic event as well as other special events such as Tim McGraw, and The Jabbawockeez. This models how their business works and flows.

This business model is after a company I made up called "App Organizer". The idea behind this is that users can search for apps by different categories, prices, functions, etc. It is an app, but helps you find apps that you would like instead of always downloading apps and trying them out and later deleting them because they don't fit your needs.
