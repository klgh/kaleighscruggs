Soo I have so crazy allergies. In addition to the regular springtime allergies that most people get, I'm also allergic to fire ants...and *running?* yeah.

Starting with the lovely fire ants. I have always known ever since I was little that if I got bit by insects I tend to have a bigger reaction than most people, just a lot more swelling. One day in June of 2009, I was sitting in my bedroom with my mom and I felt 2 painful pinches on my legs. I thought I got bit by mosquitoes since they were so itchy, but they were constantly itchy and burning. And they were swelling up pretty big. Right after, we left the house to go shopping. Before we even left the neighborhood we had to turn back so I could get some water because I couldn't stop coughing. When I tried to swallow the water, it wouldn't go down. That's when I told my mom to call 911. Within minutes firemen were at my house getting my info, and then the ambulance came and took me to the hospital. By the time I got there I had hives, and everything was swelling closed. They gave me lots of benedryl straight into my bloodstream, and I had to do a breathing treatment.  The doctor gave me a prescription for 2 epipens and referred me to an allergist.
