Even though I have a real job, I still like to work on the side making websites for people I know. For some reason, I think that this is fun. I mainly use [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/ 'WordPress') because it's super easy for non-technical people to use. I even use it for my personal sites. It's just cleaner and I have yet to find something else I want to use. At first I was hard coding HTML, but at the end of the day, it's pretty tedious to update every single page's nav bar when I want to add a new option.



If you are super bored you can check out my portfolio on my professional site. I try to update it as often as I can. A little over a month ago I began to talk to a friend of my mom's that needed some help with updates on their site. Once I got the go-ahead, I made the updates in the same week I was supposed to receive a check for my work. Weeks passed, emails were left unanswered, and invoices were left unpaid. It has been over a month and, nada. I asked my aunt Kim, who I work with, what I should do. She said to remove my work if I could. Luckily I was able to. Of course, when I tried to do it easily through godaddy.com and just revert to an old copy of the server, I couldn't get in. But luckily I could using my history on Cyberduck, and had to one-by-one, delete what I had added/changed. Tedious, but, a girl's gotta do what  a girl's gotta do.

I have learned yet another lesson in my world of codebikerun.
