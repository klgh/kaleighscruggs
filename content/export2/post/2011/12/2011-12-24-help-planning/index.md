Merry Christmas Eve!

I need YOUR help! I am trying to plan my 2012 races, at least in the Spring, so I can go ahead and get my training schedule down before classes start again. I'm thinking I want to do my first half marathon, but need some help..how far in advance should I plan for it since I've never run that far before?

I'm also planning on doing _at least_: 2 sprint triathlons & 1 olympic triathlon

and add random 5k's or 10k's that are in the area.

if anyone has any advice on how long half marathon training takes for the 1st one, spacing between triathlons, anything like that, it would be greatly appreciated!

thanks!! :)
