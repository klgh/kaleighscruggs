I just took the GRE...so now I have nothing but Christmas and New Years to look forward to! And I promise I'll be posting more. I've been going nonstop since I left school. But now...nada. Awesome.

In addition to Christmas shopping I need to do, I need to really plan 2012 out with what races and triathlons I'll be doing. The only one I know of for sure is the Triathlon at my school. But that's all I got. I'm thinking of doing my first 1/2 marathon as well. We'll see.... it sucks that not only do you have to travel to places to do races ( my first blog rhyme??) and *that* costs money, but the races do as well. poo. Once I plan my race schedule, I must plan my training schedule. I wish I wrote down my training schedule for my 1st triathlon, AFTER I did the workouts. I had a basic schedule I got from a website and had certain days I did certain things, but for the most part distances were whatever I wanted, and I never went back and said "yes I actually did this on this day".  But I think overall my training was really good since my time wasn't bad. I pushed myself, and had Shaun push me as well..especially in the pool (literally, haha). Annd that reminds me that I need to continue my bathing suit search. I'm not using a bathing suit I've had since I was 15 again!

it's tea time!! :)
