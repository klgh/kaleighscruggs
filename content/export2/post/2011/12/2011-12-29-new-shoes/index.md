Saucony's Kinvara 2! It took me forever...FOREVER...to decide on them, but I finally bought them. I was looking at a bunch of other pairs of shoes at Sports Authority..a bunch..I almost bought some Nike Frees..

since they were on clearance, but decided to stop by the shoe aisle before I left. I tired on so many shoes, and I even liked Asics Rush 33:

..and they have them for a LOT cheaper there than anywhere else right now, btw. But they were tight around my toes...I've noticed that with Asics..even my own pair. But I turned around and saw these Kinvaras in this color..I had to try them on even though they were pretty expensive, still on sale, but it's not like I don't run..soo it's a good investment. I almost left to go and decide and come back later, but decided to just do it. I also got some matching green "performance laces" aka I dont have to tie my shoes (good for Triathlons).

I also finally got a new one piece bathing suit to swim in. It's just plain black..that's all they had..maybe I'll find a cooler one later.



Tonight I went to the Atlanta Brewing Company with a bunch of friends from school. It was pretty cool, $10 for a glass you get to keep and 4 refills of beer. After we got pizza..and now I'm home! I was going to wear my new Columbia jacket, but I got home and found they left the security tag on it! So I must return to Marshalls tomorrow to get it taken off. Now I must finish my laundry since I had a pizza spill tonight.
