Actually a little more than a week left..but all the stressful stuff ends next Monday!

I feel like this past week has moved so slow and so fast at the same time. I've been going to the library almost every night with Shaun to work on my GCM project (which is now finished, and turned in!) and my term paper. My paper is due in 2 days. I have like 2 pages (out of 10) done. Oh boy!

I have been so stressed lately. Not just because of finals but also because I'm graduating in May and people keep asking me what I'm going to do next year...I have no idea! What **do** I want to do? I have no idea! I'm taking the GRE in 2 weeks (OMG!) so I guess after I get my scores back I'll see what's up/what's possible. And because I've been so stressed I've been taking it out on Shaun by either not telling him what's wrong or by being kinda mean. Which I do not mean to do at all, he's the last person who I should be getting mad at for no reason, he's the best boyfriend ever. Friday night we talked and he made me feel SO much better and we had a fun time hanging out with his roommates that night.

Saturday, me, Shaun, and Walt all went out for a bike ride around Statesboro. We rode on the new green way for the first time paved, it was a lot nicer than trying to go through the sand/gravel that was there before. We stopped at a few stores, had a late lunch and then went to the library for a few hours.

Sunday was pretty chill, went to brunch, then to the IT building to write our papers, then to the awesome Seasons of Japan for dinner.



Today has been a regular Monday pretty much, class & work. When I got to work this afternoon some of the Grad Assistants were making the wreath for a holiday party, so I helped them out with that. I also got a birthday package in the mail from my parents, but I decided to hold back and open it on Wednesday since I'll be done with my paper ( better be!) and studying for a test the next day. So it will be a good break. I'm not celebrating my birthday until Friday (or Saturday?) because both me and Shaun have a lot due this week. And that way I can throw down with everyone. I have no idea where I'm going to go or what I'm going to do, but that's what procrastination daydreaming is for right?
