Woo I am done with this semester! I'm not done working though (unless I want to be..but I need the moolah).

This semester has gone by SO fast! I feel like it should be the beginning of October not the middle of December almost! But I'm glad I don't have work and school to worry about for a few weeks. But I do have to worry about grad school and all that still. Rawr.

After I left you with my last post on my birthday, I went and had dinner with Shaun and everyone then went to his place where I had a cookie cake with 23 candles! Then I had to study. (boo!)

Thursday I took my Geology final, (passed the class, woo!), and had to go to my next class to deal with my lovely group project. I'm so glad it's over.

Somewhere between Thursday and Friday, I lost my keys! I use them to lock my desk at work..then I went to Shaun's..so I have no idea where they are. When I got to work on Friday, I couldn't find them to unlock my desk. Luckily I have a spare key with me for it and can get into my desk. And I also luckily made Shaun keys to my apartment a few weeks ago, so I can still get into my room. But I kiiiiind of need those keys. For safety reasons and so I don't have to pay hundreds of dollars to my apartment complex to replace them!

Friday night we went out for my birthday dinner at El Som. It was a fun night and we got back to Shaun's where more people came over and we hung out for the night. Saturday was a lazy day of eating, cleaning, running, eating, tv. Sunday study mode was back on and I met a study group at the library for my discrete math class...I HOPEHOPEHOPE I passed it. I find out tomorrow. Oh Boy.

Yesterday was a long day, my final for my 8AM was at 7:30AM. Gross. All we did was present each other's projects. Dumb. Then I had to take my math final after that, then had lunch with Shaun and went to my place to work on my IT Issues and Management final that was due at 5pm. I finished it and tried to nap, but I couldn't. Even though I was falling asleep as I was doing my final.

Today I had my last final at 3 for my Capstone class. Now I'm all done! I only have 2...TWO classes left of my college career. Crazy. Really Crazy.
