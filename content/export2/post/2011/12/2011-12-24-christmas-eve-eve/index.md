Merry Christmas Eve Eve! Ok technically it's Christmas Eve, but I haven't slept yet...

These past few days have flown by! What is with that lately? Not cool time, not cool!

Alright, so on Wednesday guess what I got?

guess...

...guess...

hint:!

That was actually not a hint..I got a road bike!! I'm so excited! It is the matching one to Shaun's bike. His parents got them as a wedding present..then he let a friend borrow it, then, as my Christmas present, he got the women's bike back and has given it to me!! It's a 10 speed Schwinn World, from the 80's. Excited.

When I first got on it the seat was still too high, so it felt SO WEIRD. Shaun lowered it some more (I think all the way, lol), and then it was perfect! I was riding around his neighborhood while he fixed his seat, and it was awesome! It is so easy to go so fast, then Shaun rode with me and tried to explain the gears to me. Kind of confusing, but if I don't think about it, I got it. going from trigger shifters to old school is strange.

A road bike was pretty much the only thing I wanted for Christmas this year..and I got it! :)

But of course, my big present from my parents are my Coldplay tickets...of course. I asked them for a road bike but they refused since just last Christmas I got my Hybrid. They don't get it... obviously they've never done triathlons ;) Just kidding. Kinda. :) :)

 

 

Now to cover Thursday...here's what I did:

That's not even the half of it!

I put an ad on a site last week saying I can wrap last-minute gifts for people in my area. I got an email, and went to this family's house to help them with their wrapping. They hadn't started anything, so I did ALL of it. I worked for 4 and a half hours straight. Crazy. But I earned some money, and then spent it right after at Target on my last 2 presents. good deal. ( I didn't spend ALL of it!)

 

Thursday night, my mom and I did some baking...aka dipping:

I made pretzel sticks, and chocolate covered Oreos for Shaun's family. That's not all of them, but just a peek.

 

Today, I woke up and met my mom for some shopping. We had lunch at Panera, did more shopping and came home at 3:30...crazy! I wrapped the last (I hope) presents for my family...then Shaun came over and me, him AND Lucy went running. It was her first time running with 2 people at once so at first she was a little curious, but then understood what was up. Shaun was good at getting Lucy to not pull the leash and to let me lead better. Dog whisperer. It was a great run though..I don't know how far we went...I can use Google Earth to figure it out later, but right now, it's bed time!
