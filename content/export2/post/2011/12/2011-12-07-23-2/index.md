I am 23 years old today! I feel old! It's so weird. My day has been a good one, despite the rain and walking across campus while it was raining and very windy. If I had had my umbrella, it'd be broken. It looked like a scene from a movie seeing all the umbrellas turning inside out!

My day starting at 12AM has been a long one. I have only had 4 hours of sleep. You know that lovely 10 page paper?Â  It is done, and I am still alive. I worked on it until 5:30am. I'm giving a lot of the credit of how good my paper is to Shaun because he stayed up with me to turn my brain farts and word vomit into an actual college level paper. Without his help...I have no idea what it'd be like. He is definitely the best boyfriend in the world!

Before I went to work today, I went to Starbucks to get tea and treated myself to a cake pop. They only had one left- birthday cake! Coincidence?!

When I got into work, I was greeted with a card signed by everyone in the office, as well as a note from my boss, a plate of cookies, and a Starbucks giftcard! How awesome?!

After work I made a quick powerpoint for my term paper presentation, went to class in the mentioned above weather conditions, and now I'm back at work for 15 more minutes. Then dinner and to finally find out my surprise from Shaun and the guys! And eventually I'll get home and open those presents from home!

...and study for my lovely geology lab final tomorrow morning
