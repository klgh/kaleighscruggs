Hello! I hope everyone has had a great Christmas or another holiday you celebrate.

I've been preoccupied with this bad boy:

I got a Kindle Fire! I wasn't even expecting it, I was excited, new toy/technology to play with! I've already bought 2 books on it, Tina Fey's _Bossypants_, and Mindy Kaling's _Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?_

I have also downloaded a ton of apps, and have a lot of free trials to magazines. I don't normally read magazines, so I'll see which ones I'll keep. All of them are running or related ones, so maybe I will. I got a lot of giftcards to fund them all with :)

Recap: Christmas Eve, I took Lucy running to try to get her tired for the company we were expecting this weekend. She didn't really get tired, and we stopped by the dog park on our way home, but she was uninterested in other dogs. More interested in the people.

Then my little brother and I went to Church with my grandfather, then came home and Nick, Kristen and her brothers and dad came over. My aunt and uncle, and grandfather also stopped by.

After everyone left, my parents gave each other their gifts and Max and I opened presents from grandparents and each other.

Christmas day, Nick and Kristen came over in the morning, and we all opened our stockings, then moved onto the presents under the tree! I got a lot of clothes (that I had to return because they didn't fit) and some cool stuff for triathlons.

After breakfast, everyone was playing with their new toys, and my other grandfather, my mom's dad, made a surprise visit from L.A.! He's staying with us for the week, and his sister and her family drove down from Nashville Sunday to have dinner with us and to see him. Shaun came over for dinner as well and he opened his presents from my parents, and I opened my present from his, a UK trunk! So awesome!! I'm excited to use it for school but right now it's looking pretty good in my room at home.

Monday we all went out for lunch at Firkin and Gryphon because my grandfather, his sister and her daughter are all from England. It's an English restaurant. After, my dad, Max, Shaun and I all went to hit range balls. It was a lot of fun- we got 2 buckets and both my dad and I hit the target car in the range!

Today was full of errands, returning clothes, walking around Target, and had an allergy shot. It's also my dad's dad's birthday, so I think we're gonna do cake soon. I have a lot of food to work off in 2012! :D
