This time of year is always always crazy! I have a 10 page paper due next Wednesday (also my birthday) that I haven't started on yet...I may or may not have known about the paper since August. Don't judge. I'm also working on a final project for my Multimedia class due the same day. I also have a test Friday, and a test next Thursday as well....then finals! Then the GRE a week later. My brain is hurting already.

It has gotten so cold lately, riding my bike everywhere no longer sounds fun. And I left my car at home in Atlanta...didn't think that one through. Well I did, kinda, it needs some work on who knows what. All I know is a car shouldn't shake like that and sound like it's not going to turn on!

You know how on Cyber Monday I ordered a flash drive? I got it yesterday...TUESDAY! That was lightning fast!! Thanks Amazon Prime!
