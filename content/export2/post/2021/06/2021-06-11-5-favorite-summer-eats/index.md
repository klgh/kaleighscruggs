1. [Luna Bars](http://www.clifbar.com/products/luna/luna-bar)! These are good for any season, but they're great to pack in your bag for day trips, snacks while at work, or even for a quick breakfast.  
  
2\. Fruit! I've been stopping by the Suwanee Farmers Market on Saturdays and always grab some strawberries. I'm also digging the mixed fruit (already cut up) from Publix and Trader Joes. Summer is the perfect time to eat fruit!
