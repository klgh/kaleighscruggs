We traveled to Brussels, Belgium on July 20th, for one day and night. We took a Ryan Air flight from Dublin to Brussels in the morning. The lines to get our passports looked at by Ryan Air were really long, so we were thankful that we ran down the street to catch our bus to the airport! After we got through security and found the gate, we got some breakfast. I got a scone and Shaun got a ham and cheese croissant and a Guinness. Breakfast beer.

Here's a picture of the lovely plane in Dublin: ![brusselsPlane1](images/brusselsPlane1.jpg)

The flight was a little less than 2 hours. We both slept most of the flight, somehow. Budget airlines are perfect for screaming babies. Shaun even fell asleep before the plane took off! He woke up while we were in the air, looked out the window and was surprised. I was too! The babies were so loud! Once we arrived, we got our passports stamped, and then needed to figure out how to buy train tickets. This was so difficult to figure out. All I knew is that we needed to get to Centraal Station. I knew there were trains that left the airport to take us there. Other than that, we were lost. We tried to use a kiosk at first to buy tickets but it wasn't working correctly. Then we asked someone at an information desk, and we found more kiosks and with the help of the Google translator app and Shaun's French,we bought the tickets. Once we had the tickets we looked around.... Now what? More searching until we went to the main ticket counter and asked them where we needed to go to get on that specific train. The lady pointed us down some stairs. Luckily that train was still there and was going to leave in a few minutes. We got on, and sat down, very glad to have figured that all out! That was our 1st of many upcoming confusing travel/language barriers. Done!

![brusselstrain](images/brusselstrain.jpg)![traintoilet](images/traintoilet.jpg) cool toilet!!!![brusselstrain2](images/brusselstrain2.jpg)![brusselstrain3](images/brusselstrain3.jpg) We arrived at Centraal Station, and walked to our hotel, [Hotel NH Brussels Grand Place Arenberg](http://www.nh-hotels.com/hotel/nh-brussels-grand-place-arenberg). It was a short walk luckily. It was a lot warmer in Brussels than it had been in Dublin! Once we were checked in, we showered and put on lighter clothes, and set out to explore Brussels. ![hotelBrussels](images/hotelBrussels.jpg) Planning our trip, I had no idea what to expect in Brussels, and no idea what to do. We had heard the beer, chocolate, and waffles were all good, so we figured, that that was what we would try then! We walked through Mer Du Nord, and straight to Grand Place. It was really awesome! ![grandplace1](images/grandplace1.jpg)![grandplace4](images/grandplace4.jpg)![granplace3](images/granplace3.jpg) Then we went to see Manneken Pis... ![MannekenPis](images/MannekenPis.jpg) Beautiful. Then we decided it was waffle time. \[caption id="attachment_300" align="aligncenter" width="768"\]![Cream & Chocolate](images/chocowaffle.jpg) Cream & Chocolate\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_301" align="aligncenter" width="775"\]![NUTELLA](images/nutellawaffle.jpg) NUTELLA\[/caption\] They put crack in these waffles. They were the best things in the world. Just a waffle by itself cost €1. They were so cheap...it is probably good that we weren't in Brussels for that long. But also very sad. While we were stuffing our faces with these magic foods, it started raining, so we went to Taverne Manneken Pis for some beer. \[caption id="attachment_302" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![that one's gone](images/TaverneMannekenPis1.jpg) that one's gone\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_303" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![almost gone](images/TaverneMannekenPis2.jpg) almost gone\[/caption\] We were going to go to À la Mort Subite for dinner, but the service wasn't that great getting our drinks. So we left to find somewhere else. ![alamort](images/alamort.jpg) We ended up going to a place called Nuetnigenough. It was the best food ever. We luckily decided to split their special, which was ham and something else. I cant remember, but it also came with chips (aka fries) and mayonnaise. It was one of the most delicious things we have ever eaten! Didn't take any pictures though....but here's one of a really muscular mannequin: ![mannequin](images/mannequin.jpg) After that, we walked around some more and decided on a place to buy some real Belgian chocolate. We ate it all in the hotel room once we got back there. But not before one more stop for some beer. ![grandplaceus](images/grandplaceus.jpg)![brusselsstore](images/brusselsstore.jpg)![hornbeer](images/hornbeer.jpg) Shaun really wanted to try this. We had walked by this place earlier in the day, Au Brasseur, and saw people drinking beer out of these horn shaped glasses. So we had to go back and give it a try! The next day, we woke up, and got our things packed up and ready to head to Paris! But not before we had some more waffles: ![gonewaffle](images/gonewaffle.jpg) ![anotherwaffle](images/anotherwaffle.jpg)  Then we found the underground tram station. Once again, buying tickets was tricky, but we got some people to help us out. Then of course once we had the tickets, figuring out how to put it in the machine to get to the tram was another thing. It is amazing how different every place is! Once we got to the train station, we found our platform, Shaun paid to use the bathroom, and we bought some Sprite in a little store before the train left since I wasn't feeling great. The Sprite didn't help too much since it tasted super weird. But soon, we boarded the train and were on our way to Paris!
