Weeee.. Raise your hand if you work in an office all day. I hope I made some of you literally raise your hand in your cubes.

OK so, we all have stressful days at work, amirite? I know we all do different things and they're hard in their own ways. I'm a Java developer and work for a fortune 50 company that a ton of people are dependent on. My project is pretty important and customer facing. It was less stressful when I first started it and thought nothing we were doing was live yet. But then I realized hey, we're in production and that's important shit. #stress

I made a mistake last week. On my watch after hours, our product wasn't working. I didn't know until the next day when I got to work.

Long story short my next day at work was stressful and I felt like my coworkers either didn't understand me or whatever. I needed to make it through the day in one piece so I could go sit on the couch at home.

Here's how I coped:

Tea. Lots of tea

Take breaks to talk to work friends

Print silly pictures

Sarcastically tell people they're slackers.

Go out to buy lunch (freedom!)

Went to my chiropractor where my sister in law works and my favorite niece was there! Baby holding time!

Scroll through my dogs instagram (which is really another way for me to insta stall dogs without my husband thinking I'm real weird) Side: yes my husband and I shade our instagram. No you can't get in on it too

Read quotes from comedians.

Delete old emails.

Research photos of your finish line... Aka drinks you're gonna have when you get home. And after you workout

Think of your next trip. Make a hotel reservation (with a good cancellation policy because you're being a bit rash right now!)
