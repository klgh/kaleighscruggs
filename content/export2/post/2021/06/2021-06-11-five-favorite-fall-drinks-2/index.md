Today's Friday Five link up with [Eat Pray Run DC](http://eatprayrundc.com/), [Mar on the Run](http://marontherun.com/), and [You Signed Up For What](http://www.yousignedupforwhat.com/) is getting basic....favorite fall drinks!

  

  

**Blood Orange Sangria**

I made this for our Halloween party this year, and LOVED it. I might be biased but it's really good, and [easy to make](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/134404370106660351/). I like to use [Barefoot's Riesling](http://www.barefootwine.com/our-wine/white-wine/riesling) for my sangrias. This was that and World Market's Blood Orange soda. No measuring or anything, just mix the bottles together! 

**Baileys Irish Cream Hot Chocolate**

Hot chocolate is such a fall and winter classic. At work I like to have regular hot chocolate, but once I'm home, add the Baileys! ....or anything else, I'm not picky. Here's a good [Irish Cream recipe](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/134404370106942754/). 

**London Fog**

Yum yum. A London Fog is just earl grey tea and steamed milk. Some homemade recipes say to add vanilla extract as well.

**Pumpkin Spice Latte or Chai Tea**

I can't pick one over the other. Pretty much anything pumpkin flavor screams fall to me. I discovered the [chai tea from Tazo](http://www.tazo.com/Product/Detail/65) this year and I love it. 

**Vanilla** **Rooibos Tea**

I love [this tea](http://www.celestialseasonings.com/products/rooibos/vanilla-rooibos) from Celestial Seasonings.
