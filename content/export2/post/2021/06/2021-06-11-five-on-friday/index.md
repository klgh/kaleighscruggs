This past week has flown by! Is it really Friday? (NOT THAT I’M COMPLAINING!)  
Saturday morning, we woke up really early and headed to the airport to fly to Chicago! I needed to be in Bloomington, Illinois this past Monday-Wednesday for business (SO FANCY), so Shaun and I were happy to take advantage and make a trip out of it!  
Here are 5 things I want to share about it:

1// Cheese Curds

sounds gross...terrible for you, but taste amazing. live it up!

2// Chicago is super cool (in both senses of the word...-4? WHAT)
