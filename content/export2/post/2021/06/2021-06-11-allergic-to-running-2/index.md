Long story short, I'm allergic to running. I know you're probably thinking, yeah me too. If you can run whenever you want, and don't experience shortness of breath, swollen eyes, tightening of the chest, and coughing because you can't breathe... Then you're not allergic.

But I am. I can't just go for a run. I have to pay attention to what I have eaten that day, and if it includes gluten, I should probably just stay home.

Gluten related, exercise induced anaphylaxis. That's me. If I eat ANYTHING with gluten and run within 6 hours, bring out the benadryl and get the epipen ready.  
It sounds absolutely ridiculous, and I agree, it is. It is insane and inconvenient, but it's my life. I had to figure this out the hard way. But luckily (?) I have another life threatening allergy to fire ants that requires me to carry an epipen at all times. (Also not a joke).
