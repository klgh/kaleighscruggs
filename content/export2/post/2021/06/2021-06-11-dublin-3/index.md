Shaun and I arrived in Dublin Saturday July 18th at around 10am. I slept most of the plane ride (miraculously, I never sleep on planes, trains, cars, etc) mainly because the seat back entertainment for my seat wouldn't work. Also, I was tired by the time we boarded. Shaun didn't sleep at all, and watched 2 movies during the flight. A cool highlight from the flight was that he saw a meteor burning up and woke me in time to see it burn in the atmosphere. Pretty cool!

 It was cool to see Ireland as we were getting closer to the airport. This was Shaun's first time in Europe so he was excited to just look out the window and see the land. Once we landed and got off the plane it was time for the border control. The line was pretty long, probably due to the fact we stopped at the bathrooms first and were on a flight coming from the US. But once we got our passports stamped, we were free!

I pulled out my reservation for the [Aircoach bus](http://www.aircoach.ie/) to take us to the city center. We found where we needed to wait and waited for longer than we needed to... Because we totally let the 1st bus just go without getting on it. It was my fault because it said Leopardstown and I thought, no not it... But it was. Whoops! Eventually we got on the bus and into the city. Our room at trinity college wasn't ready yet,  so we were able to drop off our bags and go explore! First stop... Guinness of course! ![guinnessbeers](images/guinnessbeers-300x225.jpg)  
 We walked all the way there. We probably could have taken a bus, but it was nice to experience the streets and the sights.

 Once we were done at Guinness, we were more than ready to get in a nap before dinner. We walked back to Trinity College and checked into our room!

 It was an apartment style dorm, so we shared 2 bathrooms with 3 other rooms like this. At first we were kinda bummed we didn't have our own bathroom, but it was never a problem. Plus we never saw the other people staying in our "apartment".

 After we took a coma, we went out to get some food and drinks. We went to [O'Neill's](http://www.oneillsdublin.com/)  but learned they were no longer serving food...it was 9:30pm. Our waitress was super nice and told us where we could find food at that time. Apparently everywhere in Europe stops serving food at 9pm we learned! After walking around, we decided on Burger King....I know I know..but we did want to try American fast food on our trip since I remember from a past trip that they serve different things, and it tastes much different than at home. I got chicken nuggets, and Shaun got a burger, and we split these cheese tater tot things that came with salsa. They were awesome! ![tomatosalsa](images/tomatosalse-300x225.jpg)  
 The next morning, we walked to [Kilkenny](http://www.kilkennyshop.com/) to have breakfast. It was a store on the bottom level and a restaurant upstairs. They had live music and a buffet type line to get your food. We got some awesome lemonade, scones, cupcake, eggs, toast, fruit...it was SO good!

 After breakfast, we just walked around and went into stores. We found a Patagonia outlet store, but none of the prices were amazing...especially when you convert them to US Dollars. We found Conor McGregor's gym, and walked around a grocery store to see what kind of stuff they sold. Then we decided to go tour Jameson. ![guinnesstruck](images/guinnesstruck-1024x492.jpg)![liffey](images/liffey-1024x560.jpg)![sbgym](images/sbgym-192x300.jpg)  
 The Old Jameson Distillery was really awesome. We were able to get student discounts, and had to wait about 30 minutes or so for our tour, but that wasn't an issue because they had a bar, so Shaun and I both ordered drinks while we waited. I got a Jameson strawberry mint julep. It was so good! Shaun got a 12 year old red breast whiskey. ![jamesondrinks](images/jamesondrinks-1024x576.jpg) The tour itself was really cool. The guide was awesome and we both learned a lot about how they make Jameson and the process. ![jamesontour](images/jamesontour-1024x1024.jpg) Towards the end of the tour we got to try 3 different whiskeys. 1 that was single distilled, then double, then triple. The single was terrible...I loved the triple! Which was Jameson! ![whiskeutaste](images/whiskeutaste-1024x768.jpg) And then at the very end of the tour, they give you more Jameson! You could either get a ginger ale with Jameson or just straight Jameson. ![endoftour](images/endoftour.jpg) After the tour, we walked around some more, and headed to [Queen of Tarts](http://www.queenoftarts.ie/) which was recommended to us by multiple people. We got a slice of the Bailey's Cheesecake and a Chocolate Fudge slice ![queenoftarts](images/queenoftarts-1024x1024.jpg) My favorite was the Bailey's Cheesecake! ![dublinsq](images/dublinsq-1024x570.jpg) After, we sat in a little square as we ate our midday dessert. Then we walked around some more and found Dublin Castle. ![dublincastle](images/dublincastle.jpg)![dublincastle2](images/dublincastle2.jpg) then we went to The Mercantile Bar and stopped for a pint. ![Mercantile2](images/Mercantile2.jpg)![Mercantile1](images/Mercantile1.jpg) Later, we had dinner at a place called Bóbó's Burgers. It was really good! After that, we set out to go to The Temple Bar, but it was soo crowded. ![templebar](images/templebar.jpg) It was late, so we headed back to our room since we needed to get packed for our flight to Brussels in the morning. ![trinity](images/trinity.jpg)
