This episode starts right where it left off. Taylor and Corinne are arguing by the fire pit. They are going at it, Taylor is trying to tell Corinne she's dumb, and Corinne is trying to tell Taylor she's not nice and has a stank face, and is getting in her head that no one likes Taylor.

Next, Corinne goes to Nick to tell him the girls have been feeling weird towards Taylor. Nick wants Corinne to continue showing her maturity...ummm if you have to say that to someone you might MARRY, maybe you shouldn't be with them. JUST A THOUGHT.

Now it's time for the rose ceremony. Sarah and Astrid home, and understandably, Sarah is PISSED she has to go home even though

The girls find out that they're headed to New Orleans, and are all super pumped. Chris Harrison tells them they they're going to have a group date, one on one, and a two on one date. LET ME GUESS WHO WILL GO!

Rachel gets the one on one date, and of course she's nervous, she got the first impression rose, and then has yet to have a one on one!

Rachel meets up with Nick and make out in a market ASAP. Then they eatÂ beignets and join a parade.

They have dinner, and Nick tells her he's super into her. He is asking about how he should address her parents and whatnot. THEY REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER.

Back at the hotel we find out who is going on the two on one, and who is going on the group date. LET'S TAKE A BET ON WHO IS GOING ON THE TWO ON ONE. Taylor and Corinne. A producer's paradise.

But let's get to the group date, before the hot mess. The ladies arrive at a house and find out it's haunted. They go in the house to get some drinks, and find out more about the house. They find out about the little girl who haunts the house, and then go on a tour. This thing is so set up.

After the tour, everyone is left to play with a Ouji board and roam the house. This was the corniest stuff ever! Suddenly things were being moved, the doll went missing, things crashed and broke. All the while Nick was having some one on one time with each of the ladies.

Danielle gets the rose for the night and peeps be pissed! But she hasn't had a lot of time with Nick in a while so0o0o0o.

Next up is the 2 on 1 date with Taylor and Corinne. They head to the Bayou to play with VooDoo and have their Tarot cards read.
