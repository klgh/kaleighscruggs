Hola peoples! I have been MIA from this blog for a little over 2 weeks (not that you noticed)! Why? Because....I just have been. No crazy reason other than I haven't sat down to write anything since my last post.

What's gone down in 2 weeks? Thanksgiving, Sim City Build It addiction, I gave blood for the 1st time, Coldplay's new album came out, and I turned 27. Fun stuff. I also missed Tumblr a bit too, so I found a cool theme to show pictures better. Check it out. 

  

Lets see....went to Jekyll Brewing:

Cleaned out MORE clothes from the closet (living near a consignment place is sweet). I fixed up an old sweater for Mac. He loves hates it.

Shaun & I had our 1st "show" for all of the tables (& other things) that he makes. [Check them out here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HoundDogWood).

Got a great deal on a fake tree from Target. It's 6ft and skinnier than a usual tree. Perfect for a small apartment with high ceilings.

I got a really cool VoxBox to review! (All that stuff will be coming later!)

I've been having a bunch of hot chocolate:

My sister in law made us this awesome wreath!

Finally bit the bullet and ordered these DNA kits for us. Of course the went on sale for Black Friday and I had already bought them.

I found sloth socks at Target!

I turned 27!

In addition to those amazing cupcakes and brownie, Shaun got me cooke sandwiches and my little bro got me a Great American Cookie slice. Strict diet starts once I finish them. ( Fun fact: I can't eat sugar like I once did. After not having any for 5 weeks this year, I'm a lot more aware/sensitive to it. The old me would have eaten all of that in one night. EEK!)

  

Biggest news: COLDPLAY'S NEW ALBUM IS OUT AND IT IS AMAZING

[![](images/IMG_20151204_075820-300x200.jpg)](https://blog.kaleighscruggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_20151204_075820.jpg)

  

If you don't know, I've been a huge Coldplay fan since I was 14. I've seen them 9 (YES) times and cannot wait for them to tour North America again. Shaun thinks I'm joking when I say we're going to see them in multiple cities when they announce this leg of the tour. 

  

  

Cool beans, so now we're caught up!
