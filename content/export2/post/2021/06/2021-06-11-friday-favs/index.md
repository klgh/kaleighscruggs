This week has flown by! Partly because I stayed home from work on Monday, but it's still been flying.

Here are 5 things I'm loving:

  

1\. My new [Hydro Flask](http://amzn.to/1GZkFaI) water bottle!  
This was part of my anniversary gift from Shaun. He has had an orange one for over a month, and I've been pretty amazed by how it keeps ice ALL DAY AND THEN SOME, and doesn't sweat. It's magic! Well worth the $$!

2\. Soup  
I must have had some bug this weekend, but it left me congested. My nose isn't running or stuffy, but I went to the doctor and she said I have fluid in my ears and my nasal passages are big and congested. This has left me with the most sore throat ever. Talking, swallowing, eating, drinking, it all is painful. Soup (and mashed potatoes) has been my jam.

3\. [The Flash](https://www.facebook.com/CWTheFlash) & [Arrow](https://www.facebook.com/CWArrow)  
I'm so glad fall TV is back. We don't have cable, so we catch up with shows on Hulu. Sunday we had 4 episodes total to catch up on, and then watched 2 more yesterday.  
  

  

  

  

4\. Halloween!!  
Halloween is coming!! I'm getting more and more excited and trying to figure out my costume for tomorrow night's party. I know what I'm gonna be next week, but we wanted to have different costumes for tomorrow.

5\. Family  
My niece _was_ due on October 11th....but she still has yet to make her grand entrance!!.... But in the meantime some of our Florida cousins are coming to Atlanta for the weekend! I love them and can't wait to hang out with them this weekend!
