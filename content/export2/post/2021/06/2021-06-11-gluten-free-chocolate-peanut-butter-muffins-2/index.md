#### Ingredients

1 peeled banana 1 large egg 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter (doesn't have to be exact!) 1/3 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder 3 tablespoons honey (agave, brown rice syrup, or maple syrup may be substituted) 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon baking soda pinch salt, optional and to taste heaping 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips + more for sprinkling muffin tops

#### Directions

Preheat oven to 400F, and prepare mini muffin pans by spraying very well with cooking spray or grease the pans; set aside.

Add all ingredients to either a blender or mixer except for the chocolate chips, and blend until smooth and creamy.

Add 1/2 cup chocolate chips and stir by hand if using a blender or carefully blend in a stand mixer.

Drop rounded 1 tablespoon mounds into prepared pans.Fill to 3/4 full.

Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, check with a toothpick.

Before leaving muffins to cool in the pan, sprinkle chocolate chips to the tops. After 10 to 15 minutes, I like to place a baking sheet over the muffin pan, flip it upside down, and then flip that onto a cooling rack. Be careful and have oven mitts on!

Once they're cooled off...ENJOY!
