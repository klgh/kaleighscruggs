My half birthday is June 7th (yes, I know it's July), but I realized then that I had only 2 1/2 years left of my 20's. First of all...um, how has that happened?? and second, CUE SCARY MUSIC.

I decided to create a list of 30 things to do before December 7th, 2018:

1\. Go back to Europe at least once

2\. get another tattoo

3\. go camping

4\. see the Grand Canyon

5\. Get a 6-Pack
