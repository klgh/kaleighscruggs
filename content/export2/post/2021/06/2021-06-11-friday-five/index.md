Woo! It’s Friday!

This week has sorta flown by. I’m happy about that since we have some fun stuff happening this weekend! #1 is that my best friend is getting married tomorrow!! Him and his fiancé have been engaged for 3 years, and are finally able to get married here in Georgia! We’re so excited for them!  
  
5\. I went shopping on Tuesday (finally) to find a dress for the wedding. I found an insane deal at Kohls. I’ll post how much I paid when I post a picture of the dress. It’s one of those dresses that shows a tiny bit of your abs. Well, in my case, where I wish my abs were. Maybe when I put it on tomorrow I’ll have abs by then?? A girl can dream…  
  
4\. Last night I did **2** Total Body Fitness classes in a row. The 1st class was tough, but I had planned on doing 2, so that’s what I did. The 2nd round seemed to take forever, but I got it done, and still gave it everything I had! Come on muscles….  
  
3\. Yesterday I was so basic! I bought 3 candles from Bath & Body Works.

2\. For some reason I decided to reorganize my [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/kleach) boards…. Why does this matter? It doesn’t. But that’s what I’m doing with my free phone time.  
  
1\. I just can’t seem to be happy with a blogging platform. I have had this Tumblr for years, but have also had blogs hosted with WordPress and Blogger. I need help figuring out my blogging life!  
_(if you have suggestions, please let me know)_  
I hope you all have a great weekend!
