...that is the question.

I have been taking this year off from triathlons. Which at first I thought would be easy, then it was hard and I was tempted to sign up for a late summer race. I LOVE triathlons. I love the training, racing, planning workouts and races. Buying new gear. It's all just so fun. But it's also not fun when you get injured.

After getting injured in 2012 with some bad shin splints, I graduated from physical therapy that winter thinking my next season would be awesome. Not so much. It was okay, but nothing special. Races were canceled, cut short, or I was penalized. Meh.

2014 was quite the year, it was when I broke my thumb and severed my tendon. This required 3 surgeries, a lot of physical therapy, and not being able to workout if at all. Plus I was planning a wedding, and laid off twice. I did one triathlon, and it was great. Maybe because I was "defeating the odds" or whatever inspirational whatever you want to say.

In 2015 I did 2 triathlons. I was supposed to do a third, but decided that jet lag was more important. They were fine, but I was in a lot of pain. My hip hurt, my foot hurt, and I just couldn't get the running thing under control. It is frustrating since I was a cross country runner and it used to be so easy, and I'd accidentally run more miles than I needed and I was just super cool. Now it's like pulling teeth.

At the beginning of this year I went to a doctor about my foot and she was trying to get me to get crazy surgery. So I went to another doctor and he said I'd be okay after a lot of anti-inflammatory. That was the case and now my foot is 98% better. But when I run now in Total Body Fitness....SHINS HAPPEN.
