On Tuesday July 21, we took a Thalys train from Brussels to Paris. The ride was a little over an hour.

![trainride](images/trainride.jpg)![windmills](images/windmills.jpg)![trainstation](images/trainstation.jpg) And then, we were in Paris! And confused again! Luckily there was a guy giving out maps and information about the metro, so we got one and I showed him on my phone the route that the Metro app told us to take, and he told us which direction of trains we needed to take. Super helpful. Then we bought the tickets, and got on the subway. ![metrostation](images/metrostation.jpg) We switched one time, and then we arrived at our stop. It was pretty cool going up the stairs to the street and seeing what Paris looked like. It was funny because it's exactly how you imagine, and you're actually there. ![parisstreet](images/parisstreet.jpg) We checked into our hotel, [Hotel Relais Bosquet](http://www.hotel-paris-bosquet.com/), and went to our room...it was time to see if we got the view we requested... ![roomview](images/roomview.jpg) AND WE DID! That was pretty cool. We changed and unpacked since we were going to be there for 2 nights (woo!), and left to see the Eiffel Tower a little closer, and to eat and then meet the group for the Fat Tire Night Bike Tour we signed up for. ![parishotel](images/parishotel.jpg)![parisview1](images/parisview1.jpg)![eiff](images/eiff.jpg) I have never been like a "ooh the Eiffel Tower, Paris is <3" kind of person, but seeing it in person is really really crazy. You think you know what it is going to be like, but then you're wrong. Paris was so hot. So we needed water. We brought our Nalgenes but didn't bring them for the bike tour, so we figured we'd buy some water bottles at a store. Wrong...there is like no water anywhere. (Water that is not sparkling water). We went to so many tiny stores searching. We were getting hangry and thangry. Finally we found 2 in some random frozen foods store. Then had to buy one more at a Subway since we drank 1 already. Insanity! At 7, it was time for our bike tour! I found it online, and then saw it again in a travel book, so I figured it would be good. And it was! We met at a place near a metro station, and walked to the Fat Tire Bikes office to get on our bikes. ![pinkpanther](images/pinkpanther.jpg) This was my bike, The Pink Panther. I ended up riding it the next day too! The bike tour was so much fun. We rode through some busy streets to get here: ![notredame](images/notredame.jpg) Then we went to a nearby street where they said any ice cream on that street is the best ice cream in the world. And it was. I got tiramisu ice cream and it was magical. ![bridge](images/bridge.jpg) I didn't take pictures of the ice cream, but we were on this bridge. Then we rode here: ![louve](images/louve.jpg) And a little bit later, we got on a boat to cruise down the River Seine. ![rivercruise](images/rivercruise.jpg)![boattour](images/boattour.jpg)![riverus](images/riverus.jpg)![sunset](images/sunset.jpg) The cruise was a nice change of pace from riding bikes, and we got to have wine, juice, and water while we went down the river. After the cruise, we rode back towards the Fat Tire office, but not before stopping by the Eiffel Tower to see it lit up! ![eiffelnight](images/eiffelnight.jpg)![eiffelus](images/eiffelus.jpg) Awesome stuff. Once we dropped off our bikes, it was around 11pm, and we were hungry. We went to a place right by the hotel called Le Bosquet and I ordered some real croque monsieur and legit french fries. Shaun got duck but wasn't too excited about it. ![croqmsr](images/croqmsr.jpg) Then it was finally time for bed. The next day, we were going on another bike tour at 11am, the Fat Tire Day Bike Tour. We got some bagels for breakfast on our way. The day tour was fun, we saw more notable buildings, and had lunch in the Tuileries Garden. ![bikes](images/bikes.jpg) \[caption id="attachment_341" align="aligncenter" width="800"\]![shaun's bike](images/bikestreetboys.jpg) shaun's bike\[/caption\] ![biketourpic](images/biketourpic.jpg)![eif2](images/eif2.jpg)![eiffeltowerday2](images/eiffeltowerday2.jpg) \[caption id="attachment_345" align="aligncenter" width="1000"\]![Tuileries Gardens](images/gardens.jpg) Tuileries Gardens\[/caption\] ![horse](images/horse.jpg)![invalids](images/invalids.jpg)![miniarc](images/miniarc.jpg)![parisbridge](images/parisbridge.jpg)![smalltower](images/smalltower.jpg)![tour](images/tour.jpg)![tour2](images/tour2.jpg) After the bike tour, we wanted to rent some of the city's bikes and see some more sights. After going to 2 stations, we were able to get some bikes to ride! We saw the Arc de Triomphe: ![arc](images/arc.jpg) which was really cool, and in such a busy area, it was ridiculous! We saw the Eiffel Tower from the other side: ![eiffeltowerday](images/eiffeltowerday.jpg) Then we got up close: ![eiffeltowerclose](images/eiffeltowerclose.jpg) We rode back to the Fat Tire office because we knew the sold water...and it was the cheapest water we'd seen. We asked for a recommendation on where to get some beer. ![auderniermetro](images/auderniermetro.jpg)![metro4](images/metro4.jpg)![metrobar](images/metrobar.jpg)![metrobar2](images/metrobar2.jpg) After this we went back to the hotel to change and figure out where to go to dinner. I found a pizza place nearby that had good reviews on TripAdvisor. When we got there it was super crowded, but we were able to get a seat inside. The waiters were rude and we ordered a pizza. The pizza was good, but not super amazing or anything. We weren't too impressed. We set out to find macaroons, but either places were closed, or they were INSANELY EXPENSIVE. Like over 50 euros for 1. No thanks...so I got a banana Nutella crepe and Shaun got some ice cream. Much better. We went back to the hotel to pack our stuff since we were leaving for London in the morning. at 10:45pm, we left to go to champ de mars to see the Eiffel Tower light up at 11. It is already lit, but each hour on the hour for 5 minutes it sparkles at night. There were so many people sitting on the lawn waiting. ![eiffeltowernight1](images/eiffeltowernight1.jpg)![eiffeltowernight2](images/eiffeltowernight2.jpg)![eiffeltowernight3](images/eiffeltowernight3.jpg) We had fun taking pictures and video. There was this guy trying to sell us beer and wine, he walked right to where we were sitting and kind of stood in the way. When he wouldn't leave after we politely declined, Shaun just says "go away" and the guy was like "go away? you go away" and then kept repeating it to himself as HE walked away. It was pretty funny. After that, we walked by the little fair type booths closer to the Eiffel Tower, and then headed back to the hotel. The next morning super early, we left to take the subway to the train station to get on the EuroStar train to London! ![eurostar](images/eurostar.png) \[caption id="attachment_379" align="aligncenter" width="896"\]![this was in the bathroom on the train](images/monalisa.jpg) this was in the bathroom on the train\[/caption\]
