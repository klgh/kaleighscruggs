My previous all-bjj post, [Jiu-Jitsu: Gear for Women](https://kaleighblogs.com/2017/12/jiu-jitsu-gear-women/) has been a huge hit via Pinterest. It's kind of wild, and I love it. I wanted to write a sort of "update" because That post is over a year old, and I wrote it long before I ever published it. So I felt like a lot has changed with the jiu-jitsu gear that I love.

## Gi

Almost a year ago I saw [The Ama Gi by Senso](https://sensobjj.com/collections/gis-kimonos/products/ama-gi) online and almost immediately bought it (I say almost because it costs $145). I found a coupon code, and then...I bought it! When I saw that aqua color I knew I had to have it. Plus it's a women's cut so it was going to fit better than others. And it does. I wasn't sure on the sizing so I measured my Fenom Gi, and got the F1. It's a snug fit, so I don't put it in the dryer, but it's great!

I also bought a new black gi since my old one was starting to show its age (it was my only gi for over a year!). [Fenom](https://fenomkimonos.com/products.html) had a great black Friday sale so I was able to get one for only $70! A steal! It did arrive looking HUGE, but once I washed and dried it, it fit perfectly.

I still like to wear my Nike compression shorts under my gi pants, but have also started wearing a pair of Lululemon shorts that are high waisted and don't ride up as much. I only have one of those, but hopefully I'll get another pair soon!
