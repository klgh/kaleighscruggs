Today when I woke up, I was still so tired from the weekend. It was also time to figure out how I'm getting to Dublin. It took me forever because the cheapest flights were leaving London early in the morning and coming back early in the morning. I didn't want to leave so early Sunday. So after a long decision making process, I decided on taking a train, then a ferry to Dublin arriving around 1pm. and I'm coming back Sunday evening ( the flight is a little over an hour). That way I have a good bit of time I'm spending in Dublin. And this is all cheaper than flying both ways. By then it was time for lunch, I have no idea what I had but it was really good. finally good food. Then I had class from 1-3:30 (so long!). After class I Googled where the nearest bookstore was, and I went to Foyles. I don't know if all bookstores here are like it, but it was huge and had so many subjects, it was pretty crazy. I found "Roadie: My Life on the Road With Coldplay", (it's not out in the US yet), and I bought it. After I left, I took the tube to Covent Garden, which is a really big market. Since it was getting late people were starting to pack up, but I was still able to get a feel for it, and went into a bunch of stores that I can't really go to everyday in the US. I'm definitely going back! Once I was tired and hot, I came back to Astor, got my Tesco bag, and hit up Tesco with my new giftcard. I felt like I was able to get so much and only spent £14\. I got things to make sandwiches with, tea, and some snacks. So now I'll hopefully be saving money and not spending it on things that I have no idea what it is. And after I was done with all this, I started working on this blog since I wanted to do one, but just haven't had time to.
