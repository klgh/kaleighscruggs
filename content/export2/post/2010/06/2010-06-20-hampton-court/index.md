After another awesome (not) breakfast in Ramsay, we made our way to Waterloo station to go to Hampton Court for the day. For some magical reason, we just scanned our Oyster cards to go. Literally we left the station, crossed a bridge over the Thames, and we were there. Hampton Court is gigantic, and really pretty. I stayed there the whole day and took over 400 pictures. I saw the kitchen, gardens, maze, apartments, and more apartments. I really enjoyed doing  the maze, and we all finished it without having to use the cheat door! After we were finished, we had lunch. I have absolutely no idea what I got, but it ended up being really good. I also bought a giant chocolate chip cookie, which was so good to eat. On our way back on the train, this guy was on the phone the entire time, and everything he was saying was so funny because he didn't care who could hear. Once we got back to Astor, I had time to take the pictures off my camera, and it was time to go eat dinner before our walk to the river. We ate at a pizza place down the street. The pizza was really thin, but really good. And cheap too. After we went on our walk to the river, which is basically down the street, way down. We saw Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Big Ben, the Eye and walked across the river. That made it real to me seeing all those. Crazy.
