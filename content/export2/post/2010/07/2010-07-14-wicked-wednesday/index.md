This morning, I decided I'd sleep in-aka not use an alarm to wake up. I woke up at 10 right on the dot. I decided I'd go to the store Cool Britannia again to get some souvenirs I couldn't get last time I was there since I didn't have enough money with me. When I changed trains on the Piccadilly line, I learned the Piccadilly Circus station was closed due to flooding. So I got off at Leicester Square and attempted to find it on my own, without a map. I didn't succeed, and was actually in the completely opposite direction. Oh well.

I came back to Astor to wait for Anna and Sara to go to lunch. and to get the newsletter! woo! We got the news letter, and I got some STRANGE variation of pigs in a blanket for lunch, that I was way too scared to eat, but I tried it and it was nasty. So I ate my potatoes, chocolate cake, bread and tea. That's good, right Mom?

After lunch, I had class. We're learning the things I'll need to study for the final. Crazy. I got my quiz back from Monday too..not bad for being away all weekend and not having my materials with me. Once class was over, we wanted to find this accessory store in Covent Garden, but we got outside and it was pouring and windy. Not a favorable combination, so we went back inside. soon after it stopped raining, and I decided to go out again and ended up in Camden Town. I did another walk by, and nothing. This is starting to be no fun, because I really really really would love to see ANYONE Coldplay related. Not just band members. My fingers are still crossed though. After yet another experience getting on a bus and ending up not where I wanted, I found the tube station and took it to Warren Street and changed to go to Victoria to see Wicked.

Wicked was amazing! I really enjoyed it even though I was in the last row and 'hired' binoculars for a pound. It was a great show, great songs, and  great story. It was also very smart and intertwined well with The Wizard of Oz. Greatness.

Now I'm absolutely exhausted and I cannot get to sleep. How great right?
