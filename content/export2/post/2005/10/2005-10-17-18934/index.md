It's been 2 weeks since I've updated, must be a record or something for me..and in 2 weeks I'll be done with cross country...yay! I'll probably miss it though..I won't know what to do with myself when I get home at 3 instead of 5...party! The meet this past Saturday was really good, I had a PR, and the course wasn't too bad...twas fun stuff. Let's see...ah, our homecoming events were all almost canceled because of shitty weather, the game I believed we lost, and the dance...haha...I was planning on going, but I was having a better time with Joe watching trains than I would have at the dance. A much better time....Then last week, xc was pretty awful and tireing, my leg is still fucked up from Marist, so it's beenÂ fun..haha..and...hmm, oh and now I'm definitely going to Europe with DYS, which I'm verrry excited about, but it will be the longest trip I've taken by myself..eehh..but it will all be good. I'll make sure of it...and I think that's about it..
