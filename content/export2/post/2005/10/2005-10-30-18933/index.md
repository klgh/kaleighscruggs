whoo hoo...cross country and all state all in one day.....the day I've been dreading is almost over!!!

Regionals were good, the boys are going to state! That was awesome. Gah, it was sooo cold this morning though...and I had to run in the 1st race at 9..it was freeeezzzinggg, but it's all good because I had yet another PR..whoop....ew, when we were at school this morning at 7, we saw a RAT! It was huge too, it came from some storage room then to the boys bathroom, and I went in there to see this rat, but not expecting to see a rat, a big ass rat. Then it ran out and everyone was screaming and jumping and whatnot...it was quite funny, but then at the same time disturbing since it is our school and all....Berry said that it was pretty awesome. Save The Rats!

Then all-state...yeaaa,ehh...I hate not knowing, and having to wait for stuff.....geezz..I have no idea about how I did..the etude was damn good (better have been),the scales...alright.Sight reading. sight reading was sight reading...I think I made up the middle part..eh...man.  Georgie was there, and again he did his weird Miss America wave to me again...what is with that? He wore his pink shirt yesterday...that was pretty funny..real men wear pink...ok, then why did he wear it?? haha, diss....

After that, I met Annette at Starbucks, and we spent like 2 hours there or something,lol. Later, Marleen came over, then we had to go to the library at 8 cuz I had stuff due that I forgot about (she let me drive her sweet car, cuz we weren't sure about my brother's honest-ness, but besides I have a week left until my 6months are up and its all good,lol), on our way we passed Annette, so she went to my house and chilled with my brothers until we got back,lol. Then it was par-tay time! lol..I love them so much!!

& I'm out! - K
