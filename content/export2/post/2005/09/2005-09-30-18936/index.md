**COLDPLAY WAS FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!**

WOW!! That was the best EVER, a more detailed update, sure to come...until then guess what happened??

Chris Martin jumped off the stage, ran to MY section and I was FIVE FEET away from him....I was FLIPPING THE SHIT OUT!!! I jumped on the row infront of me's (unfolded) chairs, so I could get closer....it was AMAZING, he was right in front of me (I am complete), and then Gywnneth Paltrow was there, in front of me, and she turned around and was pointing and like laughing at me (I was the youngest by at least 10 years, going nuts)...it was soo fucking amazing. Chris Martin looked at me!! He was there for like 3 mins...finishing In My Place, and making us go crazy...and I was singing and going crazy too,lol...AWESOMENESS..........more later...much more....
