hmm, seems like it's time for an update...today has been pretty long..I went to Kelundra's birthday party, and it took us like an hour to get there (and we got lost). It was awesome seeing her, it being like a year since we last saw each other and I knew a couple of other people there so that was good. It was a make-up party where they try to sell you stuff..ehh..I'm not a fan of make-up, so it started out as kinda awful, but at the end we all looked pretty good, but still..ew make-up. Then we went to Decatur to eat, which was good and I had so much fun..Kelundra said I've met my matches because the entire time me and these 2 other girls were pissing off the waiters and messing with shit.it was hilarious,lol. Good times....

ok, so last week, I took Annette out..we were going to find another Starbucks to go to...we got lost looking at these huge houses in Sandy Springs, I guess, and somehow ended up downtown. That was rather interesting, because we driving and then we see a "welcome to the city of Atlanta" sign..and the the GA dome, and Ikea and all those great places...we didn't know it was possible to get there from where we started out,lol, but we did it..and I had to drive back on the highway, and I'm not really supposed to be doing that...so I was "flipping the fuck out" as annette said...but afterwards...at a Starbucks in dunwoody, we laughed about it..hahaa..then the next day I was back downtown in Little 5 Points with my mom, and we wound up in a lesbian book store (Because we obviously cannot read signs...but they were so small!), so the moment we realized the short haired bitchy women walking around, lesbian mystery novels, and pride stickers, we were like "lets get the hell out of here"..we turn around and my mom was like "oh my god" and I was like "Oh so you've noticed the only guy in here too!"...uhh yea the only guys in there were my violin teacher, and his "roommate" who I can now only assume is his partner or w/e you would like to call him....and there was no way to avoid them and leave without him knowing..we were forced to say hello, and it was THE funniest thing ever...his face was so red, it was awesome,lol...then my mom and I got the fuck out of there! If there is ever an award for the most akward moment ever, that totally wins it...but I don't know on who's part...his being he saw his student in a 'feminist' bookstore when he was with his boyfriend, or ours that we were in that kinda bookstore to begin with,lol...I don't know.

Alrighty this seems long enough to me...byes
