Coldplay Fall Out

![](images/willchampion.jpg)Coldplay are battling to avoid a messy split caused by growing rifts within the band.

Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion \[pictured\] and Guy Berryman are currently enjoying the success of their third album X&Y - but bad tempers and big egos are threatening to tear the group apart. A gruelling tour schedule to promote the album means they spend all their time together, which isn't helping.

Will Champion reveals, "We're all getting on each other's tits at the moment. I suppose that's bands all over."     Source: [ContactMusic](http://www.contactmusic.com/)
