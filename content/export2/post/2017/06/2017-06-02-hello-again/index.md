Heyyyyy, so here I am. Another day, another blog. I feel like I always start blogs, and then delete them because I try to center them around one thing and then I "change" and can't continue. So this is my attempt at making this super lifestyle-esque, so that way I can just cover what I want to cover. YA KNOW?!
