Not only did January fly by, but it was a hot social media mess. FUN!

Here are my notable and fav things from January 2017!

- unfollowing people on Facebook (not unfriending, just not seeing crazy posts in my newsfeed). This has been amazing. It took some time to go through and get rid of the people I didn't want to see (and follow the ones I *do* want to see), but it's been completely worth it. Now I don't have to see political posts, or constant selfies. It's all my favorite people to stalk, dogs and food.
- INSTAGRAM HASHTAGS. I have been going a tad crazy with the hashtags, but I've definitely gained a bunch of followers from it.#InstagramGameStrong
- Sunrise photos! My company moved us into their new building, so now I'm on a much higher floor and get a great view of the sunrise every morning. I've been sharing the photos like crazy on Insta, and have no shame!
- COMEDY 2.0! I signed up for the advanced stand up writing class at Highwire Comedy with Joel Byars. I took the beginner class August-October 2016, and LOVED IT. OBVS kept it up, so I was excited to learn about the new class!
- Weird Weather!!! The weather here in Atlanta has been insane. We had snow/ice, we had hot days, and we had regular January days. You know how people usually change out the winter and summer clothes out of their closet? All mine are in there. There's no way to predict the weather.
- SHORTBREAD COOKIES. For Christmas I got a giant Costco sized tin of Walker's Shortbread Cookies. I thought it would take months to eat them all, but we embarrassingly are on the last package.
- Jiu-Jitsu! I've been trying to go more times a week. Which also has resulted in being sore and super tired, but I love it, sooooooooo....whatevs.
- I've been trying to let this whole blog thing flow instead of forcing it. Also trying to figure out if I need to make different social media for my comedy stuff or just let it stay in with everything that already exists. We shall see. IF YOU HAVE THOUGHTS, SHARE THEM.

Thanks for reading....leave a comment so I know someone reads this. Also because if you don't then you'll feel guilty and will always feel bad if you don't.
