Today is my birthday! I’m 29. TWENTY-NINE! How does this happen? It feels like I just turned 25, and everyone thinks I’m still 12. What a fun time!

29 begins the dreaded countdown to 30. I have 365 days until 30. That is absolutely insane. BUT ANYWAYS, I’m 29 and feeling fine. (I’ve been waiting to say that!).

I thought it’d be fun (and very Pinteresty of me) to create a 30 before 30 list of things to accomplish during the next year. I’ve been wanting to start this blog, so I figured it will help keep me accountable and get into blogging. I’ll also try to film as much as I can as well since I’ve been having fun with filming and editing videos lately.

After all of this is done and, to celebrate my 30th birthday, I want to have a sleepover with a sloth in Oregon. I’ve been looking forward to that since I discovered it was possible (while Insta-stalking people who have done this and I might have cried a little).

\*\*Once I created this list I realized it’s not all “jumping out of airplanes” and “bungee jump” type stuff, but it’s realistic stuff I want to do within the next year, and I believe I can do! So follow along if you’re interested. I’ll be using the hashtag #klgh30before30, and posting videos on YouTube!
