Happy Friday!! Todayâ€™s Friday Favorites is a bit different because yesterday marked 6 months into my 30 Before 30 challenge! Hereâ€™s an update on how itâ€™s going!

**1. Go back to Europe**
Still no plans yet. Weâ€™re just now making summer travel plans and I donâ€™t think a proper Europe trip would fit into our schedules right now. Maybe for Thanksgiving??

**2. Get another tattoo!**
I havenâ€™t decided yet, do people ever really decide?

**3. Go camping somewhere with some awesome views**
This is part of our summer trip plans! Iâ€™ll share more later! ðŸ™‚

**4. ~~Fully understand my 401k, stocks, and all that stuff they donâ€™t teach you in school~~**
There are actually a few classes I can take about 401kâ€™s at work, which I did take. So I kind of understand it a bit better, but definitely not at 100% yet. As for stocks, Iâ€™ve been using Robinhood and have bought, sold and have my eye on some stocks. I definitely havenâ€™t made any money yet.

**5. Get a 6-Pack (of abs!!)**
Iâ€™m trying my best. Not there yet.

**6. Visit Red Hare Brewing**
This summer I will finally go! I love their new Tangerine 50/50!

**7. Spend a weekend in Asheville, NC**
We just bought tickets to see the Milk Carton Kids in October there! Weâ€™re super excited!

**8. Get our home office furnished & cozy**
Still nothing in there, but we hang out in there a lot and have a sweet setup of blankets and pillows on the floor. So thatâ€™s pretty cozy to start withâ€¦

**9. ~~Make our backyard look super awesome~~**
Thanks to our fire pit, weâ€™re able to burn more yard trash and get the yard looking nice and clean. Next up we want to add a fence!

**10. ~~Pay off all our credit cards~~**
I did thisâ€¦and then have gotten 2 more credit cardsâ€¦Iâ€™m writing a post about this, so thereâ€™s more to come!

**11. Visit Golda Kombucha once they open in Atlanta**
They just opened a couple of weeks ago, so a friend from the gym and I are planning on hitting it up soon!

**12. ~~Have tea at Just Add Honey Tea Company~~**

**13. ~~Get cookies at Lunaâ€™s Cookie Studio~~**

**14. Go on or at least plan for another cruise**
Still trying to figure when weâ€™ll do this, but I feel like it may be Alaska!

**15. Compete in a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournament**
Iâ€™m either doing one at the end of June or one in August!

**16. Get better at filming GoPro videos and editing**
Iâ€™m trying! I just need to find more time to dedicate to this.

**17. Take this blog seriously**
Yeahâ€¦about that. I am, I just need to really show it!

**18. Visit some more states Iâ€™ve never been to**
Not sure when or where, but hopefully that will happen!

**19. Post more videos on YouTube (either GoPro videos or vlog-style)**
Working on it! Iâ€™ll definitely be doing video of our trip this summer!

**20. ~~Move to a different project at work (Iâ€™ve been on the same one for 3 years)~~**
Itâ€™s happening!! In July I will move to a new team and project!

**21. Be more consistent with my stand-up comedy**
Iâ€™m starting to write new material!

**22. ~~Visit more tea rooms in Atlanta~~**
Iâ€™ve been back to ZenTea, but I have ones I havenâ€™t been to on the list!

**23. ~~Be better at drinking water (I feel like I barely have any water!)~~**
Slowâ€¦.I get into random weeks where Iâ€™m all about water, and others where I donâ€™t really want it.

**24. Try more breweries in Atlanta**
All the breweries!

**25. ~~Try different types of food~~**

**26. Visit Monday Night Brewing**
Not yet..

**27. Take an improv class**
Hopefully this fall there will be a session on the weekend I can takeâ€¦so far all the intro ones are on weeknightsâ€¦which definitely donâ€™t work for me!

**28. ~~Update my wardrobe~~**
Slowly, I am getting better clothes, and have been getting rid of clothes I havenâ€™t worn in over a year.

**29. ~~Learn how to take and edit phone photos like a boss~~**
Working on it! Iâ€™ve been watching a lot of videos, and using more apps to play around with different ways to edit!

**30. Figure out what Iâ€™m good at**
yeaaa..

So now Iâ€™ve got 10/30 things crossed off of my list! Not exactly halfway the list at the halfway point, but better than nothing! Iâ€™ll be posting more about each one Iâ€™ve crossed off, and of course about our awesome trip coming up.
