It is definitely baking season, and these Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Peanut Butter Muffins are one of my favorite things to make. They’re super easy and are perfect if you have a bunch of bananas that may go bad soon. Most people make banana bread, but I make these (although I had so many bananas left over last week that I actually made banana bread for the first time just to mix (literally) things up).

These muffins have been a staple since we started changing up our diets over 2 years ago. We started The Virgin Diet and needed something sweet in our lives. These muffins are gluten-free and can also be low fodmap by substituting maple syrup instead of honey.

Before I get into the recipe, I made these early last week for a party I was supposed to go to on Saturday…these muffins get better over time so I made them when I was still feeling good, but then got super sick so I couldn’t go…and now we have a ton in the fridge. I guess Shaun and I will have to eat them all?

### Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Peanut Butter Muffins

#### Ingredients

- 1 peeled banana
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter (doesn’t have to be exact!)
- 1/3 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons honey (agave, brown rice syrup, or maple syrup may be substituted)
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- pinch salt, optional and to taste
- heaping 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips + more for sprinkling muffin tops

#### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400F, and prepare mini muffin pans by spraying very well with cooking spray or grease the pans; set aside.

2. Add all ingredients and mix (except for the chocolate chips), and blend until smooth and creamy.

3. Add the chocolate chips and blend.

4. Drop rounded 1 tablespoon mounds into prepared pans. Fill to 3/4 full.

5. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, check with a toothpick.

6. Before leaving muffins to cool in the pan, sprinkle chocolate chips on the tops.

If you have a standard pan, after 10 to 15 minutes, I like to place a baking sheet over the muffin pan, flip it upside down, and then flip that onto a cooling rack.

If you have a silicone pan (which I ONLY use now), they can sit in there for about 10 minutes and then I scoop them out onto the cooling rack.

Once they’re cooled off…ENJOY! We like to keep them in the fridge, but you can leave them out in a sealed container if you don’t like them cold.

Here’s a [fun Insta Story video of them being baked to random music](https://youtu.be/FDUELbY_iqE).
