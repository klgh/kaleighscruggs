        Hey peeps, I’m Kaleigh and welcome to my place on the internet! I just
        turned 30 (check out my “30 before 30” list here), and I’m a web
        developer in Atlanta. I also do improv and stand-up comedy, and love
        working out! I LOVE Instagram. So follow me! I also love Brazilian
        Jiu-Jitsu. I have been doing BJJ for over 2 years and love it. Shaun got
        me into it and he’s created a monster! And last but not least, I’m
        married to my best friend Shaun. We love to travel and try all (ALL) the
        local beers. I bet you’re wondering why this blog is called “Kaleigh
        Blogs”. Oh, you’re not? That’s good, because as you can tell I put a LOT
        of thought into it. (Actually, I did, I just couldn’t come up with
        anything better).
